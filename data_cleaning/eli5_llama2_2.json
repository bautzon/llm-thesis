      "prompt": "Why do assassins in movies / games always hold their knives with the blade facing down and not up ? [ like this ] ( URL_0 ) Please explain like I'm five.",
      "llama2": "Like a boss!  Here's the scoop:Hey there, little buddy!  So, you're wondering why assassins in movies and games always hold their knives with the blade facing down, huh?  Well, let me tell you, it's not just because they look cool that way! You see, when you hold a knife with the blade facing down, it's called a \"reverse grip.\" And here's the reason why assassins prefer to hold their knives this way:1. Better control: When you grip the knife with the blade facing down, you have more control over the weapon. You can use your fingers to guide the blade and make precise movements, which is super important when you're trying to sneak up on someone and slit their throat... I mean, when you're trying to make a clean kill. 2. Easier to stab: When the blade is facing down, it's easier to stab someone with the knife. Think about it like this: if the blade is facing up, you have to stab the person upwards, which can be a bit harder to do, especially if you're trying to be stealthy. But with the blade facing down, you can stab them from underneath, which is way easier and quieter. 3. Less likely to injure yourself: When you hold the knife with the blade facing down, you're less likely to accidentally injure yourself with your own weapon. This is especially important for assassins, who need to be quick and stealthy, and can't afford to get caught because they cut themselves. So there you have it, little buddy!  That's why assassins in movies and games always hold their knives with the blade facing down. It's not just a stylish choice; it's a practical one that helps them get the job done.",
      "chatGpt3": "Holding a knife with the blade facing down is generally a more stable and secure grip, especially when the knife is being used for thrusting or stabbing motions. When the blade is facing up, it is more likely to slip out of the hand or be deflected by an opponent. In addition, holding a knife with the blade facing down allows the user to have better control over the blade and to apply more force when making a strike. Imagine that you are holding an apple in your hand and you want to cut it in half with a knife. If you hold the knife with the blade facing up, it might be more difficult to control the blade and keep it from slipping as you make the cut. On the other hand, if you hold the knife with the blade facing down, it will be easier to keep the blade steady and apply more force as you cut through the apple. In movies and games, assassins and other characters who use knives may hold them with the blade facing down for these same reasons. It allows them to have better control over the weapon and to make more precise and powerful strikes.",
      "human": "holding the knife the traditional way gives good reach and finesse for fighting and holding the opponent at a distance . It is often a weaker grip , easier to disarm and harder to make powerful blows with . The goal of an assassin is almost always contrary to that goal . An assassin always wants a killing blow , which is more often a deep stab than a long distance slash . Finally , it looks cool . everyone holds a knife the normal way , so when you see someone holding it the other way , the assumption is they know what they 're doing and why they would want to hold it that way , which helps with the  assassin  portrayal .

      "prompt": "How come I can buy a carton of beer for $ 30 which has 24 glass bottles in it ... Yet if I buy 4 wine glasses ( which does n't even come with wine ) it costs over $ 30 ? ? . Please explain like I'm five.",
      "llama2": "Wine and beer are both alcoholic beverages, but they are produced and sold differently, which affects their prices. Here's an explanation that a five-year-old might understand:Think of beer like a big bucket of candy. The brewery makes a big batch of beer, puts it in a big bucket, and then sells the whole bucket to stores. The stores sell the beer to you, and they make a little bit of money too. That's why a big bucket of beer can be so cheap!Now, wine is like a special kind of candy that comes in small pieces. The winery makes each piece of wine one by one, and they put it in a special bottle. Then, the winery sells the bottle of wine to stores. The stores sell the wine to you, and they make more money because each bottle costs more. That's why wine is more expensive than beer!But wait, there's more! Wine glasses are like special plates that are just for drinking wine. They're made of fancy glass and they're not as big as beer glasses. The company that makes the wine glasses has to pay people to make each glass, and then they have to sell the glasses to stores. The stores then sell the glasses to you, and they make even more money! That's why wine glasses are so expensive.So, to summarize: beer is like a big bucket of candy, wine is like special candy that comes in small pieces, and wine glasses are like special plates that cost a lot of money to make. That's why beer is cheaper than wine, and wine glasses are more expensive than beer glasses!",
      "chatGpt3": "There are a few reasons why a carton of beer might cost less than four wine glasses: 1. Quantity: A carton of beer contains 24 bottles, while you are only buying four wine glasses. When you buy in larger quantities, the cost per unit (in this case, per bottle or per glass) is often lower. 2. Materials: Wine glasses are typically made from materials like glass or crystal, which can be more expensive to produce than the materials used to make beer bottles (such as glass or aluminum). 3. Brand: The specific brand of wine glasses and beer that you are comparing might also have an impact on the price. Some brands are known for using higher-quality materials or have a more premium image, which can result in higher prices. 4. Production and distribution costs: The process of producing and distributing wine and beer also involves different costs. For example, the process of making wine involves fermenting grapes and aging the finished product, which can be more time-consuming and costly than the process of brewing beer. Additionally, wine is often shipped and stored at specific temperatures to preserve quality, which can also add to the overall cost. Overall, the price of a product is determined by a combination of factors, including the materials used, the brand, the quantity, and the costs involved in production and distribution.",
      "human": "The quality of the glass is different , but more importantly the size of the prodction line , the ease with which you transport a case of beer compared to fragile goods like wine glasses , and you are missing intellectual property rights . Typically , all beer bottles look basically the same and no  real  cost has to be paid to designers . A designer can take a big percentage . Also , there are expensive beers , and cheap wine glasses . You wo n't pay that at IKEA ."

      "prompt": "Why the same products / brands have differents names in different countries ? for example : USA - Crest ; Europe - Blend - a - Med Feel free to give some more examples :) Please explain like I'm five.",
      "llama2": "There are many reasons why the same products or brands have different names in different countries. Here are some possible reasons:1. Trademark issues: In some cases, the name of a product or brand is already taken by another company in a different country. To avoid confusion or legal issues, the company may choose to use a different name for the same product in that country.2. Cultural differences: Different countries have different cultural norms and values, and what might be a popular name in one country might not be well received in another. For example, a company might choose to use a name that is more familiar or appealing to a specific cultural group.3. Marketing strategy: Companies may use different names for their products or brands in different countries as part of their marketing strategy. For example, they might choose to use a name that is more unique or attention-grabbing in a particular market.4. Translation issues: When translating a name from one language to another, it's not always possible to translate the name directly. The company may choose to use a different name that better reflects the meaning or context of the product in the target language.Here are some examples of the same product or brand with different names in different countries:* Crest toothpaste is called Blend-a-Med in Europe.* In the United States, the sports drink Gatorade is called Gator in some countries.* In Japan, the popular soft drink Coke is called \"Coca-Cola Zero Sugar.\"* In China, the search engine Google is called \"Go-go-le.\"So, the reason why the same products or brands have different names in different countries is because of various reasons like trademark issues, cultural differences, marketing strategy, and translation issues. It's like how a person might have a different name in different languages, and it's not because the person is pretending to be someone else!",
      "chatGpt3": "There are a few reasons why the same products or brands might have different names in different countries. One reason is that different countries often have different languages, and it can be easier for people to recognize and remember a brand name if it is written in their own language. For example, Crest is a brand of toothpaste that is popular in the United States, and Blend-a-Med is a brand of toothpaste that is popular in Europe. Both brands make toothpaste, but they have different names because they are marketed to people who speak different languages. Another reason why products might have different names in different countries is because different countries have different regulations about what can be sold and how it can be marketed. For example, some countries have laws that require products to have certain types of labels or warning messages, or that prohibit certain types of advertising. In order to comply with these laws, companies might need to use different names for their products in different countries. Finally, some companies simply choose to use different names for their products in different countries in order to appeal to different markets. For example, a company might use a more traditional or classic name for its products in one country, and a more modern or trendy name in another country, in order to better match the preferences of consumers in those markets.",
      "human": "Sometimes it 's for legal reasons . For example , there was already a Burger King restaurant in Australia , so in order to avoid violating the other restaurant 's trademark , Burger King was re - branded as Hungry Jack 's ( which it 's still called in Australia today ) . Other times the name is changed because it historical / cultural meaning of the original name is lost across borders . For example , Harry Potter and the Philospher 's Stone was renamed Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone for US audiences because the mythology / story surrounding the Philospher 's Stone is not part of popular US culture / common knowledge , so the name lost it 's meaning in the US and Sorcerer 's Stone was seen to make more sense . Lastly , brand names are sometimes changed because the name may have a different meaning in another culture which ( potentially ) has a negative or inappropriate connotation . For example , the Honda Fit was originally going to be called the Honda Fitta until it was discovered that ' Fitta ' roughly translates to ' pussy ' in many Nordic languages . Another example is Church 's Chicken which has been re - branded as Texas Chicken in other parts of the world where ' Church ' is assumed to have a religious connection ( as opposed to just being a person 's name ) ."

      "prompt": "How do forensic psychologists create such specific criminal profiles ? Such as the make , model and color of the car the criminal drives , the hobbies he or she might have , etc . Please explain like I'm five.",
      "llama2": "Forensic psychologists, like detectives, try to figure out who might have done a bad thing by looking at clues and putting the pieces together. But instead of looking for fingerprints or DNA, forensic psychologists look at the person's mind and behavior.To create a criminal profile, forensic psychologists might start by looking at the crime itself. They might ask questions like:* What kind of weapon was used?* Was the victim hurt in a specific way?* Was anything taken from the victim?Then, they might think about the person who might have done the crime. They might ask questions like:* Is the criminal someone who is angry or upset?* Do they have a history of violence?* Do they have any mental health issues?Finally, they might look at the details of the crime and try to picture the person who might have done it. They might ask questions like:* What kind of car might the criminal drive?* Do they have any tattoos or scars?* Are they tall or short?It's like trying to put together a puzzle. The more pieces the forensic psychologist has, the more they can understand about the criminal and the crime.For example, if a crime happened in a park and the victim was hit on the head with a rock, the forensic psychologist might think that the criminal is someone who is strong and angry. If the criminal took the victim's phone, the forensic psychologist might think that the criminal is someone who is greedy. If the criminal left the scene quickly, the forensic psychologist might think that the criminal is someone who is scared.By looking at all of these clues, the forensic psychologist can create a picture of the criminal and what they might look like. But it's important to remember that this is just a picture, and the real person might be different. It's like trying to guess what a person looks like based on their personality and behavior.So, to create a specific criminal profile, forensic psychologists use a combination of their knowledge of human behavior, the details of the crime, and their experience to create a picture of the criminal. But it's important to remember that this is just a picture, and the real person might be different.",
      "chatGpt3": "Forensic psychologists use a variety of techniques to create criminal profiles, but they do not typically include very specific details like the make, model, and color of a suspect's car or their hobbies. Instead, they focus on analyzing the characteristics of the crime and the behavior of the perpetrator to create a profile of the person who is most likely to have committed the crime. To create a criminal profile, forensic psychologists may consider factors such as the type of crime that was committed, the age and gender of the victim, and any other details about the crime scene that may be relevant. They may also review police reports and interviews with witnesses to gather additional information about the crime. Once they have gathered this information, forensic psychologists use their training in psychology and criminal behavior to make educated guesses about the characteristics of the person who committed the crime. For example, they may consider whether the crime was committed in a very organized or a very disorganized manner, which can provide clues about the personality and level of intelligence of the perpetrator. Overall, the goal of creating a criminal profile is to help law enforcement narrow down their list of suspects and ultimately identify and catch the person who committed the crime.",

      "llama2": "In a nutshell, AMD is still in business despite losing money year after year because they have a strong history, a loyal customer base, and a unique product portfolio that sets them apart from their competitors. Here's a more detailed explanation:1. Strong history: AMD has been around for over 40 years and has a rich history of innovation. They have developed many groundbreaking technologies that have changed the way we use computers, gaming consoles, and other devices. This history has helped them build a loyal customer base and a strong brand.2. Loyal customer base: AMD has a dedicated customer base, particularly in the gaming and enterprise markets. These customers are willing to overlook AMD's financial struggles because they value the company's products and the unique features they offer.3. Unique product portfolio: AMD offers a range of products that are not easily replicable by their competitors. For example, their graphics processing units (GPUs) are highly sought after by gamers and datacenter operators. Their CPUs also offer unique features like integrated Vega graphics, which cannot be found in Intel CPUs.4. Cost-cutting measures: AMD has been implementing cost-cutting measures over the years to stay afloat. They have reduced their workforce, sold off non-core assets, and renegotiated contracts with suppliers to save costs.5. Investments in future growth: Despite their financial struggles, AMD has been investing heavily in research and development (R&D) to prepare for future growth. They have been developing new technologies like 7nm and 5nm CPUs and GPUs, as well as exploring new markets like artificial intelligence and machine learning.6. Government subsidies: In some cases, governments have provided subsidies to AMD to help them stay in business. For example, in 2019, the Singapore government provided a grant of up to SGD 175 million (approximately USD 123 million) to AMD to support their R&D efforts.In conclusion, AMD has been able to stay in business despite their financial struggles by implementing cost-cutting measures, investing in future growth, and receiving government subsidies. However, the company still faces significant challenges in the highly competitive CPU and GPU markets, and their long-term viability remains uncertain.",
      "chatGpt3": "It's important to note that a company can still be successful and have a positive impact on the economy, even if it experiences losses in some quarters or years. There are a few reasons why a company like AMD might continue to operate despite reporting losses: 1. The company may have a strong financial foundation: AMD may have a large cash reserve or access to credit that allows it to continue operating despite experiencing losses. 2. The company may be investing in growth: Sometimes a company will report losses because it is investing in new products, technologies, or markets that it expects will generate profits in the future. This can be seen as a long-term investment in the company's growth and success. 3. The company may be facing short-term challenges: A company might experience losses due to temporary issues, such as increased competition, changes in market conditions, or supply chain disruptions. These challenges can be addressed over time, and the company may return to profitability once they are resolved. It's also worth noting that not all types of losses are created equal. For example, some losses may be due to one-time expenses, such as legal settlements or restructuring costs, while others may be ongoing operational expenses. This can affect how a company's losses are perceived and whether they are seen as a long-term concern or a temporary issue.",

      "llama2": "Hey there, little buddy! So, you wanna know about unions and why some people like 'em and some people don't, huh? Well, let me tell you a story!Once upon a time, there was a big group of workers who all worked together in a factory. They made things like cars and toys, and they all got paid a certain amount of money for their work. But one day, the bosses of the factory said, \"Hey, we wanna pay you less money!\" And the workers were like, \"Hey, that's not fair!\"So, the workers got together and said, \"We should form a union! That way, we can all work together to ask for better pay and better working conditions!\" And that's exactly what they did. They formed a union, and they all worked together to ask the bosses for better things.Now, some people might think that unions are a good thing, because they help workers stand up for themselves and ask for fair treatment. But other people might think that unions are a bad thing, because they can sometimes cause problems for the bosses and make it harder for them to run their businesses.So, that's why there's a big argument in America about unions. Some people think they're great, and some people think they're not so great. But the thing is, unions are just like a big group of workers working together to ask for what they deserve. And who doesn't like that?!",
      "chatGpt3": "Unions are organizations that workers can join to advocate for better working conditions, wages, and benefits. Some people believe that unions are important because they help workers have a stronger voice in the workplace and can help improve the lives of workers. Other people believe that unions can be harmful because they can make it harder for companies to do business and can lead to higher prices for goods and services. The controversy surrounding unions in America often stems from differing beliefs about the role of government and business in society. Some people believe that the government should do more to protect the rights of workers and that unions are an important way to do this. Others believe that the government should stay out of business decisions and that unions can get in the way of a company's ability to be competitive and successful. There are also often differing beliefs about the role of unions in the economy. Some people believe that unions help to create a more balanced distribution of wealth and power, while others believe that unions can hurt the economy by making it harder for companies to operate and compete.

      "llama2": "You're right that it's strange we can do all these amazing things like land on comets and send satellites to other planets, but we can't seem to put a high-resolution color camera on these devices. There are a few reasons for this.First, it's really hard to send a camera to a comet or another planet. It's like trying to take a picture of a fish swimming in the ocean from a boat that's really far away. The camera has to be able to survive the trip to the comet or planet, and it has to be able to take pictures in a place where it's really cold, really hot, or really bright.Second, cameras are really complicated and need a lot of power to work. They have to have special lenses and sensors that can take high-quality pictures, and they need a lot of electricity to power all those things. When we send a camera to a comet or planet, we can't always send a lot of electricity with it because it's too heavy and would take up too much space.Finally, there's a limit to how much we can improve cameras. Even if we had a super-powerful camera that could take high-resolution color pictures, it might not be able to send those pictures back to Earth because the comet or planet is too far away. It would take too long for the pictures to get back to us, and by the time they did, the comet or planet might be somewhere else!So, even though we can do some really cool things like land on comets and send satellites to other planets, we can't always put high-resolution color cameras on those devices. But we're always trying to improve our technology and find new ways to explore the universe!",
      "chatGpt3": "There are a few reasons why we might not have high resolution color cameras on some space probes and satellites. One reason is that these devices often need to be small and lightweight in order to be launched into space. Adding a high resolution color camera would add extra weight and complexity to the design, which could make it more difficult and expensive to launch. Another reason is that the cameras need to be able to withstand the harsh conditions of space, including extreme temperatures, radiation, and micrometeoroid impacts. These conditions can be tough on electronic devices, so the cameras need to be robust and reliable in order to function properly. Finally, it can also be expensive to design and build high resolution color cameras that are specifically designed for use in space. There are also many other scientific instruments and sensors that are needed on these probes and satellites, so there may not be enough room or resources to include a high resolution color camera. I hope this helps to explain why we might not have high resolution color cameras on some space probes and satellites.",

      "llama2": "It is not entirely true that glands in the breast that have produced milk cannot get cancer. While it is true that breastfeeding can have some protective effects against breast cancer, it is not a guarantee that breast glands that have produced milk will never develop cancer.Here's why:1. Cancer can develop in any cell in the body: Cancer is caused by mutations in the DNA of cells. These mutations can occur in any cell in the body, including cells in the breast glands. So, even if you have produced milk in your breasts, it is still possible for cancer to develop in those glands.2. Not all breast cancers are the same: There are different types of breast cancer, and some are more common in women who have never had children or have had few or no full-term pregnancies. For example, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a type of breast cancer that develops in the milk ducts and is more common in women who have never been pregnant.3. Breastfeeding may have some protective effects: However, breastfeeding may have some protective effects against breast cancer. This is because breastfeeding can reduce the number of menstrual cycles a woman has in her lifetime, which can lower the risk of breast cancer. Additionally, breastfeeding can help to maintain a healthy weight, which is also associated with a lower risk of breast cancer.So, while it is not entirely true that glands in the breast that have produced milk cannot get cancer, breastfeeding may have some protective effects against breast cancer. It is important to remember that all women, regardless of whether they have breastfed or not, should be aware of their breast health and talk to their doctor about any changes or concerns they may have.",
      "chatGpt3": "It is not true that glands in the breast that have produced milk cannot get cancer. Any part of the body, including the breasts, can potentially develop cancer. The breast is made up of various types of cells, including glandular cells, which produce milk, and connective tissue cells. Cancer can develop in either of these types of cells, as well as in other cells in the breast. The most common type of breast cancer is ductal carcinoma, which starts in the cells lining the milk ducts. It is important for all individuals to be aware of the signs and symptoms of breast cancer and to practice regular self-exams and seek medical care if they notice any changes in their breasts. It is also important to get regular mammograms and other screenings, as recommended by a healthcare provider, in order to detect breast cancer early and increase the chances of successful treatment.",

      "llama2": "The Onion Router (TOR) is a software that helps you browse the internet anonymously by routing your internet traffic through multiple nodes (computers) in the TOR network. However, even though TOR is designed to provide anonymity, there are still some ways that an attacker could potentially deanonymize a victim using TOR.Here's a simple explanation of how an attacker could potentially deanonymize a victim using TOR:1. The attacker intercepts the victim's internet traffic. This can be done by exploiting a vulnerability in the victim's computer or by tricking the victim into visiting a malicious website.2. The attacker sees that the victim is using TOR to browse the internet. This is because TOR traffic is encrypted and routed through multiple nodes in the TOR network, but the attacker can still see that the traffic is coming from the victim's IP address.3. The attacker tries to exploit a vulnerability in the TOR network. TOR is open-source software, which means that its code is publicly available and can be reviewed by anyone. If an attacker finds a vulnerability in the TOR code, they can use it to exploit the network and potentially deanonymize the victim.4. The attacker uses a technique called \"traffic confirmation attack\" to confirm that the victim is using TOR. This is done by sending a fake \"onion\" packet (a packet that looks like it was sent through the TOR network) to the victim's IP address. If the victim's computer responds to the fake packet, the attacker knows that the victim is using TOR.5. The attacker uses a technique called \" Sybil attack\" to trick the TOR network into thinking that the attacker's computer is a legitimate node in the network. This can be done by creating many fake identities (called \"Sybils\") and using them to send traffic through the TOR network. By doing this, the attacker can manipulate the network and potentially deanonymize the victim.6. The attacker uses the information they have gathered to deanonymize the victim. For example, if the attacker knows that the victim is using a certain TOR node, they can try to trace the victim's internet activity back to their real IP address.It's worth noting that these attacks are not easy to perform and require a significant amount of resources and expertise. Also, it's important to note that these attacks are not unique to TOR and can be applied to other anonymity tools as well. Additionally, TOR developers and community are constantly working to improve the security and anonymity of the network, and they have implemented measures to prevent or mitigate these types of attacks.",
      "chatGpt3": "TOR, or The Onion Router, is a network that allows users to browse the internet anonymously by routing their traffic through multiple layers of servers, or nodes, before it reaches its destination. This makes it difficult for anyone to trace the traffic back to the original user. However, TOR is not completely foolproof, and there are ways that an attacker could potentially deanonymize a victim using the TOR network. One way this could happen is if the attacker is able to compromise a node in the TOR network and monitor the traffic passing through it. If the victim is using a vulnerable device or operating system, the attacker may be able to exploit a security flaw to reveal the victim's IP address or other identifying information. Another way an attacker could potentially deanonymize a victim using TOR is by setting up a fake node on the TOR network and enticing the victim to connect to it. The attacker could then monitor the victim's traffic and potentially reveal their identity. It's important to remember that while TOR can help protect your anonymity online, it is not a guarantee of complete anonymity. It's always a good idea to use caution and take steps to secure your device and protect your personal information when using the internet, whether you're using TOR or not.",
      "human": "The news article you posted does n't do a great deal of explaining , but the [ published paper ] ( URL_0 ;) is quite useful . Particularly , the attack summarised through the following steps : 1 ) Client downloads a file from the server that colludes with the adversary . 2 ) While the download progresses , the server injects a repeating traffic pattern in the TCP connection it sees originating from the exit node . 3 ) After sometime the download process is stopped and the server halts the traffic shaping procedure . 4 ) The adversary obtains network statistics from flow records corresponding to the server to exit traffic and for the various clients that used the victim entry node for the duration of the attack experiment . 5 ) If the flows are not correctly aligned , equally long and evenly separated , then the adversary applies the approximation strategy to correctly align them . 6 ) The adversary thereafter computes correlation coefficient for the server to exit traffic network statistics and for all the individual clients that used the victim entry node during the attack experiment . 7 ) The victim client ’s statistics is expected to be most correlated to the server to exit node traffic . Thus the client , whose traffic statistics are most correlated to the exit node traffic are chosen as the victim and verified . Basically , if the NSA controlled a service you were trying to access via Tor , they could send specially shaped packets to act as a sort of label . Even though the data is encrypted and anonymised through Tor ( between the entry and exit nodes ) , if the NSA controlled a lot of routers or major Internet exchange points , they could still track the special packets from the server to the first exit - node , through the middlemen , and finally ( and imperatively ) back through the original entry node & back to your original connection . But that 's not nearly ELI5 enough so I 'll do a * really simplified * analogy which gets the idea across : * * TL;DR * * - say Tor was n't actually an Internet thing and instead was a way of anonymously sending physical mail . If the sender of the parcel was malicious ( eg , an NSA controlled honeypot site ) they could send out really heavy parcels instead of normal , small , letters . So even if the parcel gets repackaged in different boxes or wrapping paper with new labels on ( the middlemen trying to anonymise the post ) , at the end of the day , the client is still going to be receiving a really heavy ass parcel . Even though it may look different , the weight of the packet indicates it 's the same packet which the NSA sent out . Which , in and of itself is pretty useless . But if the NSA controlled most of the postmen , they can just ask them if anyone got a really heavy parcel delivered that day . If they 're lucky , one of the postmen they control remembers delivering a super heavy parcel to 23 Jump Road , Michigan , USA . And then you 're fucked . But critically this relies on two things : having control of the end server , and being able to monitor major Internet exchange points in near real - time , and we 're talking hundreds if not thousands of gigabytes per second here . Theoretically yes Tor is vulnerable but this paper does n't prove it can actually be exploited in any meaningful manner to intercept communications between two end users that want to remain anonymous ."
