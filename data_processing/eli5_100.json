The New York Times best seller list is a weekly list that ranks the best-selling books in the United States based on sales data from a number of different retailers. The list is published in the New York Times newspaper and is widely considered to be one of the most influential best seller lists in the book industry. \nIt's important to note that the New York Times best seller list is not the only best seller list out there, and there are many other lists that rank the top-selling books in different categories or in different countries. So it's possible that a book could be a best seller on one list but not on another. \nAdditionally, the term \"best seller\" is often used more broadly to refer to any book that is selling well, regardless of whether it is on a specific best seller list or not. So it's possible that you may hear about a book being a \"best seller\" even if it is not specifically ranked as a number one best seller on the New York Times list or any other list."

Yes , it costs more to transport salt than it does to produce it . ) Salt does its job ( lowering the freezing point of water ) incredibly effectively and is ludicrously abundant in nature . Its crystalline structure can also be manipulated in order to have sharper edges that reduce bounce . So that allows it to stick evenly to critical surfaces such as roads .

                    "Salt is used on roads to help melt ice and snow and improve traction during the winter months. When it's cold outside, water can freeze on the roads and make them very slippery, which can be dangerous for cars and people. Salt helps to melt the ice and snow by lowering the freezing point of water, which means that it can help keep the roads clear and safe to travel on. \nThere are other options for melting ice and snow on roads, such as using chemicals like calcium chloride or magnesium chloride, or using mechanical methods like plows or sand. However, salt is often the most effective and affordable option for many communities, especially when it's used in combination with other methods. \nIt's important to note that while salt can be helpful for making roads safer during the winter, it can also have negative effects on the environment and on the cars themselves. Salt can cause corrosion on metal surfaces, including cars, and it can also harm plants and animals if it washes into nearby waterways. However, despite these potential downsides, many communities continue to use salt as a way to keep roads clear and safe during the winter."

                    "The way it works is that old TV stations got a certain amount of bandwidth to replace their old analog TV stations . However , HD takes up more bandwidth then SD - so the stations can choose between 2 or 3 HD stations , or like 7 or 8 SD stations ( or a mix of both ) They can do a bunch of SD stations and make more money in advertizing by running 7 or 8 different reruns of old SD TV shows at a time In fact , those stations often got permanent rights to show an unlimited number of reruns of old syndicated shows in perpetuity . That means they do n't even have to pay anyone to air old eppisodes of _ Star Trek _ or _ Alf _ So basically it 's free money for them , based on being around for a long , long time and having their old rights get upgraded as new technology comes out .",

                    "There are a few reasons why SD channels still exist : 1 ) SD channels typically consume much less bandwidth than HD channels , so it is possible to carry many more SD channels than HD channels over the same coaxial cable or wireless spectrum ( for antenna broadcasts ) . This point does not apply when a television service provider carries both HD and SD versions of the same channel though . 2 ) Broadcasts formatted for HDTVs ( in 16x9 aspect ratio ) will typically have important details / information cut - off if displayed on an older 4:3 television screens . The SD - specific channels are often formatted especially for older 4:3 screens so that important graphics / information / details etc . do n't get cut - off . 3 ) Not all TVs / tuners are capable of receiving HD broadcasts even though they may be capable of receiving digital SD broadcasts . 4 ) With respect to cable TV , some cable companies still carry analog SD channels which can be received by older television sets without the need of a digital - to - analog adapter . If everything was switched to digital / HD , older televisions would need to be outfitted with a special adapter in order to receive service ( which is already the case in some areas ) . 5 ) A few televisions stations ( typically local / low - budget stations ) are still using old cameras , video processing and transmission equipment from the 90s or early 2000s and have n't yet invested in upgrading their equipment to support HD broadcasts ."

                    "There are a few reasons why we still have SD (standard definition) TV channels: \n1. Some people still use older TVs that are not compatible with HD (high definition) signals. These TVs can only display SD channels, so if we only had HD channels, those people wouldn't be able to watch TV. \n2. HD channels take up more bandwidth than SD channels, so it's not possible to have as many HD channels as we have SD channels. This means that if we only had HD channels, some channels might not be available. \n3. HD channels also require more expensive equipment to produce, so some TV stations might not be able to afford to upgrade to HD. \nOverall, it's important to have both SD and HD channels so that everyone can watch TV, regardless of what kind of TV they have or how much money they have."

For example, airplanes were used for transportation, for carrying mail, for crop dusting, and for military purposes. This meant that there was a lot of demand for airplanes, which in turn encouraged more people to work on developing and improving airplane technology. \nDuring World War I, airplanes became even more important because they were used for fighting in the war.

This can be influenced by things like the availability of cheap, new products and the convenience of being able to just buy a new item instead of trying to fix the old one. \nFinally, in some cases, the cost of repairing a product might be more expensive than buying a new one. This can happen if the product is very old or if the parts needed to fix it are hard to find or very expensive. In these cases, it might make more sense to just buy a new product instead of trying to repair the old one."

                    "EDIT , Nov 21 : By popular demand , now includes Midrange decks and Limited formats . Also , a new section on where players get their cards . Magic : The Gathering is a collectable card game . It can be played in several different formats , but in the most common , two players create decks out of the cards they own and play against each other . Generally , the cards in a deck are either lands or spells . Lands provide the energy needed to cast spells , and spells usually do one of the following : - Summon a creature that can fight for you or an artifact that you can use . ( * * Creatures * * and * * Artifacts * * ) - Create a lasting effect that affects the game as a whole or one or more cards in play . ( * * Enchantments * * ) - Create an instantaneous effect that affects one or more cards in play or an effect that lasts a single turn . ( * * Sorceries * * and * * Instants * * ) - Summon a sort of \" teammate \" that has its own abilities . ( * * Planeswalkers * * ) The primary goal is to run your opponent out of life points by attacking him with creatures or damaging him directly with spells . There are other ways to win , such as running your opponent out of cards in his deck . The gameplay is complex . The players take turns , but many types of spells can be cast on an opponent 's turn , or in response to a spell that they are trying to cast . A critical play by one player may be countered by the other , and that counter itself countered by the first . There are many thousands of cards out there , and you are not expected to know about them all . The Comprehensive Rules ( * not * including the text of cards ) are nearly two hundred pages , although a lot of that consists of old mechanics that are rarely used or highly - specified details that are rarely relevant . The learning curve is pretty steep , but a few games suffice to learn the basic rules . The complexity is more similar to Dungeons and Dragons than to most card games . A key feature of M : tG is the concept of * * color * * . There are five colors : Red , Green , White , Blue , Black . Each is \" allied \" to two others and \" opposed \" to the two others . Most spells require mana of a certain color to cast , which is produced by different types of land cards . Each color has distinct strengths and weaknesses – for example , blue has the best counterspells , but it 's not very good at simply hitting things . A given deck will usually use from one to three colors of card , although in some situations decks with four or five colors can work . In addition , it is often considered that there are three general archetypes of deck ( with a * lot * of variation within each category ) : - * * Aggro * * decks focus on dealing damage ASAP to win ASAP . They usually have cheap creatures ( \" weenies \" ) that can be used right away and \" buff\"-type spells to eke out a few more points of damage . They usually win fast or not at all , because they often ca n't stand up to the more powerful creatures and spells that are played later in the game . - * * Control * * decks focus on preventing the opponent from acting until the player is ready to win with powerful spells or abilities . They run a lot of counterspells , destruction spells , and things that make action more expensive for the opponent , along with a few creatures strong on defense and disruption . They usually win by using cheap defenses against expensive attacks until they are ready to overwhelm the opponent with their accumulated strength , and lose if they just ca n't stay ahead of the enemy 's attacks . - * * Combo * * decks rely on a few combinations of cards that can lead to a near - instant victory . There * are * infinite combos in M : tG , but they 're designed to be difficult or resource - intensive to pull off . A combo deck will usually run ( in addition to the all - important combo pieces ) \" tutor \" cards that let them search their deck , protection cards to guard the combo pieces , and just enough stall cards to prevent a quick defeat . A combo deck wins when it gets its combo in place before losing , and loses if it ca n't get the combo out in time or ca n't protect it long enough to use it . - * * Midrange * * decks are a common intermediate archetype between Aggro and Control . Midrange tries to beat down the opponent with damage from powerful creatures ( colloquially , \" fatties \" ) rather than with cheap ones ( \" weenies \" ) . These decks have to run enough control to stay alive until the big hitters come out . They win when they get the hitters out early enough to do lethal damage , and lose when they ca n't get the big guys out at all ( being out - controlled ) or when they just take too much of a beating too early ( being out - aggro'd ) . --- Many different kinds of people play M : tG. There are professional players who win large sums at tournaments , groups of friends who play casually on the weekends , and everything in between . If you 're playing competitively , it can be absurdly expensive , as you can not compromise on getting the perfect cards for your deck , but if you and your opponents are playing casually , it 's a lot cheaper . The most common formats are as follows . Two - player games are the norm for tournaments , but casual matches are often multiplayer . * * Constructed * * formats call for pre - constructed decks built from each player 's personal collection : - * * Standard * * : Decks are made of cards printed in about the last 18 months . - * * Modern * * : Decks are made of cards printed since about 2003 ( minus a ban list ) . - * * Legacy * * : Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a ban list ) . - * * Vintage * * : Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a * very small * ban list ) . - * * Commander * * ( or \" EDH \" ): Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a ban list ) , but limited to one of each card . One creature card is designated as your \" commander \" and is nearly always available for summoning . A popular multiplayer format . * * Limited * * formats feature decks made on the spot from a limited pool of cards : - * * Sealed * * : Each player opens several randomized booster packs and makes a deck from the contents . - * * Draft * * : A group of players open many packs and use a system to pick their cards from the contents , then build a deck from what they have . These formats cost money each time to play , because you need to buy booster packs . However , you can play them without having any of your own cards beforehand . Limited play can be a good way to pick up more cards . A relatively new casual format is * * Cube * * , in which you and your group put together a large pile of cards beforehand and use them in place of booster packs . This eliminates the recurring expense , although you need to have enough cards beforehand . There are others formats , including Conspiracy , Planechase , Pauper ( use no rare cards ) . Two - Headed Giant ( play with a partner ) , and many more . Formats that allow older cards tend to be more expensive , because the cards have been out of print for a long time . Commander is a bit cheaper than other formats that allow old cards , because you only can have one of each card ( other formats usually allow up to four of each card ) . I play Commander with my D & D group . None of us puts that much money into it , and we try to keep it more fun than competitive . Some of the players also play in local mini - tournaments on Friday nights ( \" Friday Night Magic \" ) , usually breaking about even . --- So , where does one get cards ? Most cards come from randomized booster packs with 15 cards each . Cards from a given set are designated either common , uncommon , rare , or \" mythic rare \" . You can buy booster packs for around $ 3.50 USD from retailers , or you can buy them as part of a limited tournament . There are also pre - made decks that you can buy directly from Wizards of the Coast . Each one has a theme and cards intended to work together . You wo n't win any tournaments with a pre - made deck , but it can be a good starting point . In addition , there are a couple of products intended for beginners , such as the \" Deck - builder 's toolkit \" with a semi - randomized selection of cards and a big stack of common lands . ( Common lands are dirt cheap , but it would take quite a few booster packs to get enough to build a deck . ) Most M : tG players trade cards with their friends or at events to get the specific cards they need . In addition , there is a thriving market of single cards at game stores and online . Some very , very old cards are very , very rare and expensive . A single [ Black Lotus ] ( URL_0 ) can cost many thousands of dollars . But these cards are not legal in most formats , and most players will never have seen one in person . When playing casually , your group may allow the use of \" proxy \" cards to substitute for the pricey ones . Myself , I 've only been playing for a year or so , and I do n't actually own my own cards ! ( My friends have a ton of extra decks to lend out . ) I 'm planning to build my own Commander deck soon , and I 'll be starting from a pre - made deck from Wizards and supplementing it primarily with trades with friends and singles from the internet .",
                    "Magic was invented , I want to say around 1994 , and was the first playable trading card game of its kind . Its format inspired more mainstream games , like Pokemon and Yugioh . I personally have known players as young as 8 or 9 , and as old as people in their 30 's and 40 's . Basically , the premise is that you 're a wizard fighting other wizards using magic spells . These spells are powered by a type of energy called mana , which is typically drawn from land . These spells can be used to summon creatures to fight for you , to help you and your creatures , or to harm your opponent and his creatures . Each player starts with 20 life points , and typically loses when they are reduced to 0 life points . There are five colors of mana , which represent the fundamental themes of the game . White represents order and justice , green represents nature and strength , red represents war and chaos , black represents death and self destruction , blue represents illusion and deception .",
                    "Something that I find helps understand the game a great deal : Richard Garfield , pHD made the game as an economics paper . He wanted to see how people allocate resources , but also loved Dungeons and Dragons . If you look at the first set , you have your initial creatures of each color as an Angel ( W ) , Dragon ( R ) , Wurm ( G ) , Djinn ( U ) and Vampire ( B ) . The mana sources were played once a turn , and how you used it mattered . You could use your one mana to play a creature , or allocate those resources towards something else . You could destroy someone 's ability to produce resources . You can avoid creatures ( monsters ) all together . As the game progressed , it branched out greatly from basic D & D. Now we have entire sets of cards dedicated to a single mythos . We had 2013 as a Greek mythology themed sets , complete with gods interacting with mortals , two years before that we had a whole set of gothic horror complete with werewolves , giests and families of elitist vampires . The game has thousands of cards , some extremely valuable , some not , but it all started to see if we could attach some modicum of economics to D & D."

Prions have the same amino acid sequence as their properly folded brethren , but they are folded differently , and they make a chain reaction by folding their brethren to be like them .

                    "Prions are tiny particles that can cause serious and often fatal diseases in people and animals. They are made up of proteins, which are important building blocks in the body. Normally, proteins have a specific shape that helps them do their job. But prions are abnormal proteins that have a different shape, and they can cause other proteins around them to change shape too. When this happens, it can cause problems in the body because the proteins are not able to work properly. \nPrions are not viruses, and they do not contain any genetic material (like DNA or RNA) like viruses do. Instead, they are thought to be able to change the shape of proteins by acting as a kind of template for other proteins to copy. \nPrion diseases can be very serious and are often fatal. Some examples of prion diseases include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, also known as \"mad cow disease\") in cows. These diseases can be transmitted through contaminated food or medical equipment, but they can also occur spontaneously in some people. \nThere is currently no cure for prion diseases, and they can be difficult to diagnose. Researchers are working to better understand how prions cause disease and to find ways to prevent and treat these conditions."

                    "There are a few reasons why movie companies might choose to build sets rather than film on location: \n1. Control: Building a set allows the filmmakers to have complete control over the look and feel of the environment in which they are shooting. This can be especially important if the story takes place in a fantastical or fictional world, or if the filmmakers want to create a specific mood or atmosphere. \n2. Cost: While it may seem like it would be cheaper to film on location, this is not always the case. Renting a location can be expensive, especially if the filmmakers need to use it for an extended period of time. Additionally, the filmmakers may need to pay to use certain locations, or they may have to pay to have the location altered in some way to suit their needs. \n3. Logistics: Filming on location can also be logistically challenging. The filmmakers may need to deal with crowds, noise, and other distractions, which can make it difficult to get the shots they need. Additionally, the filmmakers may not have access to all of the resources they need on location, such as electricity, water, or special equipment. \n4. Safety: Finally, building a set can be safer for the cast and crew. Filming on location can involve dealing with hazards such as traffic, unstable terrain, or inclement weather. By building a set, the filmmakers can create a controlled environment where these hazards are minimized. \nOverall, building sets can be more expensive upfront, but it can also be more cost-effective in the long run, as it allows the filmmakers to have greater control over their shooting environment and reduce the risk of delays or unexpected costs."

                    "I 'm going to go off the assumption that you do n't know what tor is , if you do then feel free to skip the next paragraph . The entire idea behind tor is that by bouncing your information through different relay points , each of which is secured and the data transfers between them are encrypted , thus making your communications much harder to trace back to you . If I turn on my computer and use a regular browser , lets say Firefox , my computer requests that a specific bit of information from , lets say , reddit . My request is sent from my computer , to my ISP 's servers , to the servers of the website and then takes the little bit of information , lets say a specific webpage , and then does that same process in reverse . Taking the information from the servers of the website to the ISP 's servers and then back to my computer . Tor complicates this process by , rather then doing a straight line of data from computer to ISP to site , first encrypting all the communication and then secondly bouncing that signal / request for data around before submitting the request for information . This has the effect of making you appear like your in another place and posses a different IP address then you actually do . Simply put , a Tor node is one of the small parts of the jump that obfuscates your physical location and IP address by bouncing your information . An exit node is a tor node that serves as the ' exit ' point from the tor network and sends the actual request for information from the site . Hopefully that clears this up , if you have anymore questions just ask . :)",
                    "Tor is an encryption system that bounces your data between dozens of computers around the world , each computer unravelling one layer of encryption that tells it who to send it to next , to make it tough to trace . Each one of those computers is a node , and the one at the end of the chain - where your data hits the rest of the internet - is an exit node .",
                    "TOR is a routing system and stands for ' The Onion Router ' because it works in layers , just like an ogre or an onion . A TOR node is a node that participates in a TOR network , i.e. a server somewhere on the planet . The exit node is just the last node in a given configuration , i.e. the node just before the server you want to reach . TOR is used to hide the identity of the user . TOR works like this : you take your message and encrypt it with multiple encryption algorithms - one for every TOR node you want to route through . Thus layers . You do it in the following order : the most outer layer is encrypted so the the very first TOR node and only the very first TOR node can decipher it . The second outer layer is encrypted so the the second TOR route can decipher it and so on , and the last layer is encrypted so that the exit node can decipher it . This means that if you send your message to the first node he gets rid of the most outer layer . The message is still scrambled and unreadable because there are still as many encryption layers as there are TOR routes left . Now , provided you use end - to - end encryption on top of using TOR this system becomes pretty good at hiding your identity because for every single node in the configuration the node only knows where any given message came from and where it has to go . It does n't know if it 's the first one that got the message or the last one and it does n't know what 's written in it . So , unless every single TOR node in a configuration is corrupted you can be sure that your identity is hidden ."

                    "Digital Rights Management (DRM) is a technology that is used to protect and control access to digital content, such as music, movies, ebooks, and software. It is often used by media companies, content creators, and publishers to prevent unauthorized copying and distribution of their content. \nThere are many different ways that DRM can be implemented, but generally it works by encrypting the content and requiring users to authenticate themselves before they can access it. For example, if you want to play a song that has DRM on it, you may need to enter a special code or password in order to unlock it. \nDRM can be controversial because it can make it more difficult for people to use the content that they have purchased in the way that they want to. For example, if you buy a song from a store and it has DRM on it, you may not be able to play it on all of your devices, or you may have to jump through some hoops to get it to work. This can be frustrating for users, especially if they feel like they are paying for something that they can't fully use. \nThere are also concerns about DRM being used to track users or limit their freedom to use the content in certain ways. Some people believe that DRM is unnecessary and that it does more harm than good, while others argue that it is necessary to protect the rights of content creators and prevent piracy."

Once you accept that , then move to- there will always be an economy in the US which will generate economic activity that can be taxed .

Given our historical growth rate , most people think we could have debt growth of about 3 % per year ( ~480 billion ) and never reach this point , because the growth in the economy via inflation , population growth and true growth allows the economy to expand to meet the increased debt levels . Since our current deficit is at around this level , there is virtually nothing to get concerned about .

This can make it harder for the country to fund things like infrastructure, education, and healthcare. \nIf a country is not able to pay off its debts, it could default on its loans. This means that it would not be able to make the required payments to its lenders and could potentially lead to financial problems for the country. \nIt's important for countries to try to pay off their debts, but it's not always possible to do it all at once. Instead, they might make a plan to gradually pay off their debts over time.

One reason people may experience this sensation is due to changes in their body position while they are sleeping. When you are lying down, your body is in a state of relative stillness. However, if you move or shift positions while you are sleeping, your body may perceive this movement as falling. This can trigger a reflex that causes you to feel like you are falling or to experience a sensation of vertigo. \nAnother reason people may experience the sensation of falling in their dreams is due to changes in their brain activity while they are sleeping. During the dreaming stage of sleep, known as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the brain is more active and may produce vivid and sometimes strange or surreal dreams. In some cases, the sensation of falling may be part of the dream content and may be related to the dreamer's feelings or emotions. \nFinally, the sensation of falling in dreams may be related to the way our brains process and interpret sensory information while we are asleep. During sleep, our brains are still receiving and processing sensory information from our surroundings, even though we are not consciously aware of it. This sensory information may be incorporated into our dreams and may contribute to the vividness and realism of the dream experience. \nOverall, the sensation of falling in dreams is a normal and common experience that is caused by a combination of factors related to body position, brain activity, and sensory processing during sleep."

                    "There are a few reasons why a carton of beer might cost less than four wine glasses: \n1. Quantity: A carton of beer contains 24 bottles, while you are only buying four wine glasses. When you buy in larger quantities, the cost per unit (in this case, per bottle or per glass) is often lower. \n2. Materials: Wine glasses are typically made from materials like glass or crystal, which can be more expensive to produce than the materials used to make beer bottles (such as glass or aluminum). \n3. Brand: The specific brand of wine glasses and beer that you are comparing might also have an impact on the price. Some brands are known for using higher-quality materials or have a more premium image, which can result in higher prices. \n4. Production and distribution costs: The process of producing and distributing wine and beer also involves different costs. For example, the process of making wine involves fermenting grapes and aging the finished product, which can be more time-consuming and costly than the process of brewing beer. Additionally, wine is often shipped and stored at specific temperatures to preserve quality, which can also add to the overall cost. \nOverall, the price of a product is determined by a combination of factors, including the materials used, the brand, the quantity, and the costs involved in production and distribution."

For example , there was already a Burger King restaurant in Australia , so in order to avoid violating the other restaurant 's trademark , Burger King was re - branded as Hungry Jack 's ( which it 's still called in Australia today ) . Other times the name is changed because it historical / cultural meaning of the original name is lost across borders . For example , Harry Potter and the Philospher 's Stone was renamed Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone for US audiences because the mythology / story surrounding the Philospher 's Stone is not part of popular US culture / common knowledge , so the name lost it 's meaning in the US and Sorcerer 's Stone was seen to make more sense . Lastly , brand names are sometimes changed because the name may have a different meaning in another culture which ( potentially ) has a negative or inappropriate connotation . For example , the Honda Fit was originally going to be called the Honda Fitta until it was discovered that ' Fitta ' roughly translates to ' pussy ' in many Nordic languages .

                    "There are a few reasons why the same products or brands might have different names in different countries. One reason is that different countries often have different languages, and it can be easier for people to recognize and remember a brand name if it is written in their own language. For example, Crest is a brand of toothpaste that is popular in the United States, and Blend-a-Med is a brand of toothpaste that is popular in Europe. Both brands make toothpaste, but they have different names because they are marketed to people who speak different languages. \nAnother reason why products might have different names in different countries is because different countries have different regulations about what can be sold and how it can be marketed. For example, some countries have laws that require products to have certain types of labels or warning messages, or that prohibit certain types of advertising. In order to comply with these laws, companies might need to use different names for their products in different countries. \nFinally, some companies simply choose to use different names for their products in different countries in order to appeal to different markets. For example, a company might use a more traditional or classic name for its products in one country, and a more modern or trendy name in another country, in order to better match the preferences of consumers in those markets."

The efficacy of criminal profiling is hotly debated . It does n't help that shows misrepresent what it is and how well is works .",
                    "In certain situations , it may be possible to infer some psychological traits or characteristics of the criminal through profiling with a reasonable degree of accuracy based on factors such as who the targeted victim(s ) were , where the crime took place , what evidence was left at the crime scene , whether the crime scene was left neat / clean or messy / dirty , etc . The degree to which these profiles are accurate tends to increase with the number of data - points ( e.g. crime scenes ) that the profiler has to work with ( i.e. that are believed to be linked to the same offender ) . Profiling specific details ( e.g. a particular car model ) can not be done with any sort of accuracy unless the profiler has additional information ( e.g. physical evidence or eye - witness accounts ) which leads him / her to make such a conclusion . It is possible , however , that certain evidence may lead the profiler to suspect the criminal drives a certain type of vehicle . For example , evidence may suggest that the crime was politically motivated and the offender is an environmental protection activist . It may therefore be predicted that the offender drives an environmentally friendly electric / hybrid car . If , on the other hand , the criminal is suspected of being a hunter and weapons enthusiast , it may be predicted that he drives a utility truck of some sort which has lots of storage space . Criminal Profiling is still a hotly debated topic in Forensic Psychology because - although many profiles do turn out to be quite accurate - there are many criminals who are eventually caught and do n't end - up matching the predicted profile . The forensic utility of profiling is still questioned and it 's important for people to realize that these profiles are merely educated guesses and law enforcement should not eliminate or ignore suspects who do n't fit the suspected profile .

                    "Most of the traditional \" real - life \" FBI profiles are more demographic - based than psychology - based .

Based on that data they 're able to predict certain things about an offender with a certain degree of accuracy : age ( or at least experience level ) , race -- since most sexual criminals tend to victimize those of their own race -- background / living situation , and so on . In addition , there are certain other things that are more specific . For instance , if a murder is carried out \" military style \" , then they might surmise that the killer has military or law enforcement experience . If the crime scene is haphazard or disorganized , they may surmise that the killer is less experienced and probably younger , while a \" neater \" crime scene indicates someone who 's been at it for a while . The real misconception about profiling in terms of how it 's portrayed in popular culture , I think , is that it 's often shown as a more intuitive process , which only certain hyper - imaginative / hyper - empathetic individuals are able to carry out . This is where characters like Will Graham from the show \" Hannibal \" or Frank Black from \" Millennium \" come in , who are portrayed as having an almost quasi-(if not explicitly)psychic ability to \" see through the killer 's eyes \" or what have you ."

                    "Forensic psychologists use a variety of techniques to create criminal profiles, but they do not typically include very specific details like the make, model, and color of a suspect's car or their hobbies. Instead, they focus on analyzing the characteristics of the crime and the behavior of the perpetrator to create a profile of the person who is most likely to have committed the crime. \nTo create a criminal profile, forensic psychologists may consider factors such as the type of crime that was committed, the age and gender of the victim, and any other details about the crime scene that may be relevant. They may also review police reports and interviews with witnesses to gather additional information about the crime. \nOnce they have gathered this information, forensic psychologists use their training in psychology and criminal behavior to make educated guesses about the characteristics of the person who committed the crime. For example, they may consider whether the crime was committed in a very organized or a very disorganized manner, which can provide clues about the personality and level of intelligence of the perpetrator. \nOverall, the goal of creating a criminal profile is to help law enforcement narrow down their list of suspects and ultimately identify and catch the person who committed the crime."

There are a few reasons why a company like AMD might continue to operate despite reporting losses: \n1. The company may have a strong financial foundation: AMD may have a large cash reserve or access to credit that allows it to continue operating despite experiencing losses. \n2. The company may be investing in growth: Sometimes a company will report losses because it is investing in new products, technologies, or markets that it expects will generate profits in the future. This can be seen as a long-term investment in the company's growth and success. \n3. The company may be facing short-term challenges: A company might experience losses due to temporary issues, such as increased competition, changes in market conditions, or supply chain disruptions. These challenges can be addressed over time, and the company may return to profitability once they are resolved. \nIt's also worth noting that not all types of losses are created equal. For example, some losses may be due to one-time expenses, such as legal settlements or restructuring costs, while others may be ongoing operational expenses. This can affect how a company's losses are perceived and whether they are seen as a long-term concern or a temporary issue."

The pro - union counterargument is that without unions the employers will have minimal pressure to actually raise wages , and that factors such as workplace favouritism could end up with two employees doing the same work for different amounts of pay , therefore it is better to have the employer and the union negotiate the wage for everyone ."

                    "The news article you posted does n't do a great deal of explaining , but the [ published paper ] ( URL_0 ;) is quite useful . Particularly , the attack summarised through the following steps : 1 ) Client downloads a file from the server that colludes with the adversary . 2 ) While the download progresses , the server injects a repeating traffic pattern in the TCP connection it sees originating from the exit node . 3 ) After sometime the download process is stopped and the server halts the traffic shaping procedure . 4 ) The adversary obtains network statistics from flow records corresponding to the server to exit traffic and for the various clients that used the victim entry node for the duration of the attack experiment . 5 ) If the flows are not correctly aligned , equally long and evenly separated , then the adversary applies the approximation strategy to correctly align them . 6 ) The adversary thereafter computes correlation coefficient for the server to exit traffic network statistics and for all the individual clients that used the victim entry node during the attack experiment . 7 ) The victim client ’s statistics is expected to be most correlated to the server to exit node traffic . Thus the client , whose traffic statistics are most correlated to the exit node traffic are chosen as the victim and verified . Basically , if the NSA controlled a service you were trying to access via Tor , they could send specially shaped packets to act as a sort of label . Even though the data is encrypted and anonymised through Tor ( between the entry and exit nodes ) , if the NSA controlled a lot of routers or major Internet exchange points , they could still track the special packets from the server to the first exit - node , through the middlemen , and finally ( and imperatively ) back through the original entry node & back to your original connection . But that 's not nearly ELI5 enough so I 'll do a * really simplified * analogy which gets the idea across : * * TL;DR * * - say Tor was n't actually an Internet thing and instead was a way of anonymously sending physical mail . If the sender of the parcel was malicious ( eg , an NSA controlled honeypot site ) they could send out really heavy parcels instead of normal , small , letters . So even if the parcel gets repackaged in different boxes or wrapping paper with new labels on ( the middlemen trying to anonymise the post ) , at the end of the day , the client is still going to be receiving a really heavy ass parcel . Even though it may look different , the weight of the packet indicates it 's the same packet which the NSA sent out . Which , in and of itself is pretty useless . But if the NSA controlled most of the postmen , they can just ask them if anyone got a really heavy parcel delivered that day . If they 're lucky , one of the postmen they control remembers delivering a super heavy parcel to 23 Jump Road , Michigan , USA . And then you 're fucked . But critically this relies on two things : having control of the end server , and being able to monitor major Internet exchange points in near real - time , and we 're talking hundreds if not thousands of gigabytes per second here . Theoretically yes Tor is vulnerable but this paper does n't prove it can actually be exploited in any meaningful manner to intercept communications between two end users that want to remain anonymous .",

I have n't seen evidence to confirm that however that does n't mean it 's not true . With that being said from my understanding it 's commonly accepted that TOR alone is n't safe enough . You have to follow to a T their instructions to make sure you are running things exactly as they say ie no flash , etc . In addition to that most people recommend using VPN . Using Starbucks internet rather than you 're home connection could n't hurt also .

                    "TOR, or The Onion Router, is a network that allows users to browse the internet anonymously by routing their traffic through multiple layers of servers, or \"nodes,\" before it reaches its destination. This makes it difficult for anyone to trace the traffic back to the original user. \nHowever, TOR is not completely foolproof, and there are ways that an attacker could potentially deanonymize a victim using the TOR network. One way this could happen is if the attacker is able to compromise a node in the TOR network and monitor the traffic passing through it. If the victim is using a vulnerable device or operating system, the attacker may be able to exploit a security flaw to reveal the victim's IP address or other identifying information. \nAnother way an attacker could potentially deanonymize a victim using TOR is by setting up a \"fake\" node on the TOR network and enticing the victim to connect to it. The attacker could then monitor the victim's traffic and potentially reveal their identity. \nIt's important to remember that while TOR can help protect your anonymity online, it is not a guarantee of complete anonymity. It's always a good idea to use caution and take steps to secure your device and protect your personal information when using the internet, whether you're using TOR or not."

A pirate might wait in the shipping lanes a day or two outside of a busy port and wait for a target . Or he might wait for a ship to dock and become a sitting target in an undefended port . A third choice is to cruise near nautical choke points like between islands or outside sandbars . Large convoys of vessels also usually took predictable routes , there was a range of a few degrees which offered the fastest trip to and from Europe due to trade winds and currents , and ships tried to avoid sailing in storm and hurricane season so there tended to be a good deal of activity when it was optimal for sailing . Once a ship was in sight it was then just a matter of who was the better seaman , or which ship was to windward , and in many cases some luck . Ships might be in sight but 20 miles away and still be in a chase .",

Write a letter to everyone you know to every possible port and ship your target might encounter . Then make copies . Leave the letters for the packets to pick up . Packets were small , robust , but fairly fast ships that were the stagecoaches of the day . Part bus , part mail service , and always smelly and cramped . The packets would run a route picking up your letters and dropping them off at the destinations . Some packets would n't make it or the mail would simply be destroyed enroute . Which is why you made copies . Other times the packet would leave a letter in every port intended for a specific ship . Which is why you made copies . With luck and few weeks or a few months later the letters would be read . Your friends write back and describe the condition of the ship , where it was seen , and what activity it may be up to . Which you 'll read weeks or months later . However now you have a reasonable idea where to start the search . If the ship has weed on the hull then it will be slow and easier to catch . If the ship 's rigging is old and frayed then it will be slow and easier to catch . If the ship 's sails are thin and patched then it will be slow and easier to catch . So now you have an estimate of the speed . Then does the ship have enough water ? Is the ship using gunpowder excessively or conservatively ? Now you can start to guess how well supplied the ship is . This gives an idea of intent . Once the search region is known then it 's all about guessing where the ship will head next . Does the ship head for fresh water ? Does the ship head to a port for food or supplies ? Does the ship head to sea for mischief ? There are only so many interesting places to go . The most direct routes between these places form routes . Guess the destination and either get there first or attempt to intercept the ship at sea between destinations . Wait for days or weeks . Guess right and the sail should appear on the horizon . Now the chase begins . The winner is the faster ship or the one that does n't make the mistake . Luck , such as with the weather gauge , plays a huge factor on who chases whom . Guess wrong and spend the next few weeks or months repeating the process .",

One common method was to use visual clues, such as looking for the sails or smoke from the ship's chimney.

By looking at the position of the stars and other celestial objects, sailors could determine their own location and the direction they were heading. They could then use this information to figure out where other ships might be located. \nSailors also used maps and charts to help them navigate the oceans. These could show them the locations of land masses, reefs, and other hazards, as well as the directions of the currents and winds. By using these tools, sailors could plan their routes and figure out the best way to reach their destination. \nFinally, sailors might use their own senses, such as hearing and smell, to help them locate other ships. For example, they might be able to hear the sound of another ship's anchor being dropped or the smell of wood smoke from its chimney. \nOverall, while tracking down other ships was difficult before the invention of modern technology, sailors were still able to use a variety of tools and techniques to navigate the oceans and locate other ships."

In this case , the material absorbs some wavelengths and reflects others . No new wavelengths are added . Thus mixing colored paints , it will absorb more colors , causing fewer wavelengths to be reflected back . If mathematically inclined , think of additive sources as a union and substractive pigments as an intersect .",

For example, red paint reflects red light and absorbs other colors. When you mix red and green paint together, the resulting color is a brownish color because the pigments in the paint are absorbing all of the colors of light except for brown. \nOn the other hand, when you mix two colors of light together, like red and green, the resulting color is a bright yellow because the light is actually adding together. This is because light is made up of different wavelengths of energy, and when you mix two colors of light together, you are adding the wavelengths of energy together. \nSo, the reason why mixing paint results in a different color than mixing light is because paint absorbs certain wavelengths of light, while light adds different wavelengths of energy together."

On the contrary , Flash is no longer supported by Apple 's devices , and by Android 's stock browser . Another disadvantage of Flash is that it 's considered slow and inefficient .",
                    "Essentially Flash is a product , whereas HTML5 is an open standard agreed upon by the internet 's \" governing body \" . Flash is a separate program that is run embedded within the browser , whereas HTML5 is a new version of the HTML markup language used to lay out web pages that is simply rendered by the browser natively . HTML5 is a W3C standard ( it is defined by the World - Wide - Web Committee , a group that defines common standards for Internet protocols and technologies ) whereas Flash is a proprietary product , owned by Adobe . IMO ( as a Solution Architect - a person who designs large scale software systems ) and former software engineer and web developer HTML5 is far superior . The open standard thing is important as it means that all vendors * should * implement the way they render it in the same way as opposed to Flash which requires you to download and keep updated an extra program as well as your browser . HTML5 is very capable in terms of animation and etc which * used to * require Flash ( or Microsoft Silverlight , a similar product ) and performs better in every case I have seen , although as it has only just been ratified as a standard I have n't yet seen any HTML5 games , for example . I 'm sure they 're out there though !",

                    "Flash and HTML5 are both technologies that are used to create and display content on the internet. Flash is a software platform that was developed by Adobe and is used to create animations, games, and other interactive content. HTML5 is a version of the HTML programming language that is used to create the structure and layout of websites and web applications. \nAs a user, it's important to know that Flash and HTML5 are not directly competing technologies. They are simply two different ways of creating and displaying content on the internet, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. \nHere are some key differences between Flash and HTML5: \nCompatibility: Flash requires a separate plug-in to be installed in your web browser in order to work, while HTML5 is built into most modern browsers and does not require any additional software. This means that HTML5 content is generally more widely compatible and can be accessed on a wider range of devices, including smartphones and tablets.\nPerformance: HTML5 content tends to perform better than Flash content, especially on mobile devices. This is because HTML5 content is designed to be lightweight and efficient, while Flash content can be more resource-intensive and may not run as smoothly on some devices.\nSecurity: Flash has a reputation for being less secure than HTML5, as it is more susceptible to malware and other types of online threats. HTML5, on the other hand, has built-in security features that help to protect against these types of threats. \nUltimately, which technology is \"better\" for you as a user will depend on your specific needs and preferences. If you need to access interactive content or games on the internet, then Flash may be a good option for you. If you are primarily interested in accessing static content (such as text and images) or using web-based applications, then HTML5 may be a better choice."

If you put the pizza in an oven that is not hot enough, it will take longer to cook and the crust may not turn out as crispy as you'd like. \nAs for the instructions to keep the pizza frozen while preheating the oven, this is probably because the pizza will cook more evenly if it goes into the oven frozen. When the pizza is frozen, the heat of the oven will thaw and cook it gradually, rather than going straight from cold to hot and potentially cooking unevenly. \nOverall, following the instructions on the pizza box (such as preheating the oven and keeping the pizza frozen) can help you achieve the best possible results when cooking your pizza."

When you order something from Amazon, the company uses its computer systems to find the item you want in one of its many warehouses around the world. These warehouses are like giant stores where Amazon keeps all of the items it sells. \n2. Once the computer finds the item, it tells a worker to pick it up and put it in a box. \n3. The box is then sent to a sorting facility, where it is sorted and sent to a package delivery company like FedEx or UPS. \n4. The delivery company then takes the box and brings it to your house. \nSo, Amazon doesn't necessarily have big factories in every state, but it does have a network of warehouses around the world where it keeps a wide variety of items.

Senators realized they could exploit this rule to keep the majority from passing a bill , unless they had a 60 - vote majority ( a \" Fillibuster - proof majority . \" Filibusters used to require a significant investment of time .

It's called filibustering because it can involve a politician giving a very long speech or talking for a long time in order to delay the vote. \nFilibustering is considered a valid tactic in politics because it allows politicians to have a say in the decision-making process and to express their views and concerns. It can also be used as a way to force a compromise or a change in the proposal being considered. \nHowever, filibuster can also be used as a way to block or delay important decisions or progress on important issues. Some people argue that filibuster should be reformed or limited in order to allow the government to function more efficiently and to make sure that important issues are not held up for too long. \nOverall, filibuster can be a useful tactic for ensuring that all voices are heard and for allowing for discussion and debate, but it can also be abused and used to obstruct the work of the government."

Since then, many other important space missions have launched from Florida, including the Apollo missions to the Moon and the space shuttle program. \nFinally, Florida has a lot of open space and good weather, which makes it a good place to test and launch rockets.

                    "It's important to remember that Japan is a country with a rich and diverse culture, and like any other country, it has a range of cultural practices and expressions. While it is true that Japan has a reputation for being a more traditional and conservative culture, it is also home to a vibrant and creative media industry. \nThe Japanese media industry is known for producing a wide variety of content, including video games, TV shows, and music, that often incorporates elements of Japanese culture and history. This can include things like traditional Japanese instruments and themes, as well as more modern and unconventional elements. \nIt's also worth noting that different parts of Japanese culture can have different levels of conservatism. For example, some aspects of Japanese culture, such as traditional family structure or gender roles, may be more conservative, while other parts of Japanese culture, such as the media industry, may be more open to experimentation and innovation. \nOverall, it's important to remember that Japan is a complex and multifaceted culture, and it's not fair to generalize or stereotype all aspects of Japanese culture based on a few specific examples."

                    "Hi ! I 'm from New York . You 've gotten some good answers , but maybe I can help go more in - depth . The very first thing to remember is that in more expensive cities , wages rise with cost inflation . Now , it 's not a perfect scale-- most of the cost inflation comes because many people are * very * rich , not necessarily because the poor are less poor . However , it 's still a factor-- there are fewer minimum wage jobs , and/or you 're more likely to get a job whose wages are above the federal minimum . In other words , chances are the same job netting you $ 7.25 in Nebraska will get you around $ 10 in NYC . Now that 's not 100 % true . There are still * some * minimum wage jobs here . How do people get by ? Well , about like anywhere else , I suppose . They do n't get to enjoy many aspects of the city where inflation has taken hold . They do n't get to go out to dinner at the nice restaurants or go drinking in NYC bars . They ca n't go to Whole Foods , they have to go to cheaper grocery stores . They have to curb themselves more , and * * they get government assistance * * like anywhere else . Remember , the farther you go from NYC the cheaper things get , so many times people will live far away from the city if they do n't make a lot . And if they 're living far away from the city , and working a minimum wage job ... they can just as easily find one near where they live . Hence , like I said , there being less minimum wage jobs in the city . It all ... * kinda * evens out . You 're not likely to live in NYC and have a minimum wage job as an adult . Matter of fact I ca n't think of a single minimum wage job I 've had , and I 've made the rounds as a student . Office worker , busboy , waiter , receptionist ... they all paid around $ 10 . And one last thing to remember : The cost of living does n't * have * to be high in this city . It 's totally doable on less money . The reason it seems higher is that it * can * be higher . And most people making very little tend to have a social circle where people make standard ( remember how I said there are n't many minimum wage jobs here ? It 's rare ) So what happens is most of your friends can go do things and spend money where you can't-- so it * seems * like everything has to be so expensive here . But it does n't , really . Like I said earlier , there are cheap places to live , there are cheap restaurants , cheap grocery stores . There are plenty of free activities for entertainment . This city actually caters very well to the poor , it 's just difficult if your social circle is n't as poor as you ."

                    "It can be difficult for people with minimum wage jobs to get by in cities like New York and Los Angeles where the cost of living is high. These cities have high costs for things like housing, food, and transportation, which can make it hard for people who don't have a lot of money to afford the things they need. \nOne way that people with minimum wage jobs can try to make ends meet is by finding ways to save money. For example, they might look for cheaper places to live, such as shared apartments or homes, or they might try to find ways to save money on food, such as by cooking at home instead of eating out. \nAnother way that people with minimum wage jobs can try to get by is by finding ways to make more money. This might involve getting a second job, finding ways to earn extra money on the side, or even starting their own business. \nIt's also important for people with minimum wage jobs to be smart about their money and to make a budget to help them stay on track. This might involve setting aside money for important expenses, like rent and bills, and cutting back on unnecessary expenses, like going out to eat or buying expensive clothes. \nOverall, it can be challenging for people with minimum wage jobs to get by in cities with high costs of living, but with careful planning and hard work, it is possible to make ends meet."

As for the gear , after it is recovered back to a FOB ( Forward Operating Base ) all gear that was worn by a casualty is inspected by people certified to determine whether it is serviceable .

                    "There are a few reasons why gas prices have gone down in the past few months. \nOne reason is that there is currently a lot of oil being produced around the world. Oil is used to make gasoline, so when there is a lot of oil available, it can help to lower the price of gasoline. \nAnother reason is that people are using less gasoline due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people are staying at home and not driving as much, which means there is less demand for gasoline. When there is less demand for a product, the price of that product tends to go down. \nFinally, some countries produce and export a lot of oil, and the price of oil is often influenced by the relationships between these countries and how they trade with each other. If there is a lot of oil being produced and exported by certain countries, it can help to lower the price of gasoline. \nSo, in summary, gas prices have gone down because there is currently a lot of oil being produced, people are using less gasoline due to the pandemic, and the relationships between oil-producing countries can also affect the price."

Some people believe that Banksy is the pseudonym of a single person, while others believe that it may be a group of artists who work together. \nThere are a few ways that experts can tell if a piece of graffiti is by Banksy or not. One way is by looking at the style of the artwork. Banksy's art has a distinctive style that is instantly recognizable to many people, and experts can often tell if a piece of graffiti is by Banksy just by looking at it. \nAnother way to tell if a piece of graffiti is by Banksy is by looking at the location where it was created. Banksy often creates his graffiti in secret and in unexpected places, so if a piece of graffiti is found in a place where Banksy is known to have worked, it is more likely to be by him. \nFinally, experts can also use other clues to determine if a piece of graffiti is by Banksy, such as the materials and techniques that were used to create it. For example, Banksy often uses stencils to create his graffiti, so if a piece of graffiti was made using stencils, it is more likely to be by him. \nOverall, while it is not always possible to know for certain if a piece of graffiti is by Banksy or not, experts can use a combination of these methods to make an educated guess."

HTML5 and GIFs serve different purposes and are used for different types of content on the web. \nHTML5 is more efficient than GIFs in terms of data usage because it allows you to display images and other types of media directly in the HTML code, without having to use separate image files. This means that you can include images and other media on your web pages without adding extra data to your website. In contrast, GIFs are separate image files that have to be downloaded separately from the HTML code, which can increase the amount of data needed to load a web page. \nHTML5 is also faster than GIFs because it allows you to display media directly in the HTML code, rather than having to load separate image files. This can make your web pages load faster, especially on devices with slower internet connections. \nOverall, HTML5 is a more efficient and flexible way to display media on the web compared to GIFs, which is why it is more widely used today.

This is a way of speaking that we have inherited from the way that English has evolved over time, and it is not based on any inherent qualities of the objects themselves. \nOne reason why we might use \"she\" to refer to a ship is because ships have traditionally been given feminine names, especially in naval contexts. For example, a ship might be named after a woman or a mythological figure, such as the USS Constitution (also known as \"Old Ironsides\") which was named after the United States Constitution. Because ships are often given feminine names, it has become common to refer to them using feminine pronouns. \nIt's also worth noting that different languages have different ways of referring to inanimate objects. In some languages, all nouns are either masculine or feminine, and the gender of the noun determines the gender of the pronoun used to refer to it.

The Earth spins on its axis, which is an imaginary line that goes through the North Pole and South Pole. This is what makes it feel like the sun is rising and setting every day. If the Earth stopped spinning, the sun would just stay in one place in the sky and it would be very hot on one side of the Earth and very cold on the other side. \n2. The Earth's spin also helps to keep the oceans moving. If the Earth stopped spinning, the oceans would all pile up on one side of the Earth, and there would be a huge wave on the other side. \n3. The Earth's spin also helps to keep the atmosphere moving. If the Earth stopped spinning, the air would all pile up on one side of the Earth and there would be very strong winds on the other side. \n4. Finally, if the Earth stopped spinning, everything on the Earth would be thrown off into space. This includes all the people, animals, and buildings on the Earth. It would be a very big mess! \nSo, in short, if the Earth stopped spinning it would be a very big problem and cause a lot of problems for everyone and everything on the Earth."

If they are successful in moving the ball 10 yards, they earn another set of downs. If the offense fails to move the ball 10 yards, possession of the ball is turned over to the other team (called the defense). \nOne way for the offense to move the ball is by throwing it through the air (called a pass). The offense can also try to move the ball by running with it (called a rush). \nIn the situation you are describing, it was probably considered \"bad\" for the Seattle Seahawks to pass the ball because it may not have been the most effective way for them to move the ball and get closer to scoring. There could be a number of reasons why passing the ball may not have been the best choice, such as the defense anticipating the pass and intercepting the ball, or the quarterback (the player who throws the ball) not having enough time to throw the ball due to pressure from the defense. \nIt's also possible that the team had been trying to pass the ball and were not having success, and so it may have been more effective for them to try to run the ball or use a different strategy to try to move the ball down the field. Ultimately, the team's decision on whether to pass or run the ball will depend on a variety of factors, including the specific strengths and weaknesses of the offense and defense, the situation on the field, and the overall game plan."

                    "Doctors can use several different methods to find out if a person has allergies. One common method is to do a skin prick test. During this test, a small amount of an allergen (such as a substance that a person might be allergic to) is placed on the skin, and then a needle is used to prick the skin through the allergen. If the person is allergic to the allergen, they will develop a raised bump or rash on their skin. \nAnother way to test for allergies is to do a blood test. During this test, a blood sample is taken from the person and sent to a laboratory, where it is tested for the presence of antibodies to specific allergens. Antibodies are proteins produced by the body's immune system in response to an allergen. If the person has allergies, their blood will contain high levels of these antibodies. \nIt's important to note that doctors do not usually test for allergies by exposing a person to the allergen directly. This is because allergies can cause serious reactions, such as difficulty breathing or a drop in blood pressure, and it would be dangerous to intentionally trigger these reactions. Instead, doctors use safer methods, such as skin prick tests and blood tests, to test for allergies."

Cancer is the result of a mutation that removes the cell 's ability to repair or quarantine mutations . It is n't that so much of DNA is devoted to reproduction that any one mutation is likely to damage that section of the DNA . It 's that , of all the mutations that happen , the ones that can survive and reproduce are necessarily the ones that alter the normal reproduction / cell death processes ( and these are the mutations that cause cancer . )",

                    "So , with cancer , what is actually happening is a few things . First of all its not just one mutation . Your body mutates constantly , DNA is always messed up , and even then your RNA gets spliced up and you are making faulty proteins all the time . Mutation is actually how things evolve partly . The concept with cancer is actually different than just mutation . Think of a car . If you cut the gas , well it wo n't move . Sometimes DNA will mutate and your body will find it and wo n't make it duplicate or be transcribed during transcription . Now DNA also can actually not be picked up by \" scanners \" when it mutates sometimes . We can call this cutting the breaks . So during transcription lots of crap happens that 's not supposed to , and so we just let it go inside the cell and push everything that has been made out of the nucleus to get eaten up by lysosomses ( cell stomachs ) . Now normally for actually cancer to happen , we need about 5 breaks cut and 10 gas pedals broken . It takes a lot of DNA fuckup to actually cause cancer . And if it does happen , we have this awesome enzyme called p53 , which Is actually one GIGANTIC and I mean FUCKING HUGE protein made to just deal with cancer . An about 5000 different enzymes to detect it and stop it . Cells also realize there is cancerous cells and go about trying to kill it , but then if we cut another 5 break lines and another 4 gas pedals in that cancerous cell , it wo n't tell other cells its cancerous . After that there s a tint threshold were the cell will try to kill itself , but one more break line cut , and that 's it . Its pretty hard for this process to occur .

However, some DNA mutations can cause problems with the way cells function, and can lead to the development of cancer. \nCancer is a disease in which cells in the body grow and divide in an uncontrolled way. Normal cells in the body follow a specific pattern of growth and division, but cancer cells do not. They continue to grow and divide even when the body does not need them, and they do not die when they should. This can lead to the formation of tumors, which can be harmful if they grow in certain parts of the body or if they spread to other parts of the body. \nThere are many different factors that can increase the risk of developing cancer, including genetics, environmental factors, and lifestyle factors. DNA mutations can play a role in the development of cancer, but they are not the only cause. \nSo, to answer your question: DNA mutations can sometimes lead to cancer, but this is not always the case.

Essentially it comes down to this : you want to create as much lift as possible , for as little drag as possible , using the smallest amount of weight possible . And , of course , it has to be structurally sound . The plane in the picture would probably collapse . The wings are creating drag , so they are all being pushed backward , and those skinny pylons would likely break . On top of that , the drag would be trying to tip the plane backward . Even if it was strong enough , it would n't fly well , if at all . Multiple wings do work , and did for all of WWI , but a more powerful engine , a stronger single wing , and a swept back wing shape are all designed for strength and efficiency . The most efficient design is two long skinny wings , but material strength has n't quite made that possible for commercial use .",

Early airplane prototypes lacked solid aerodynamic information for how to design wings and , as a result , had very inefficient wings ( very little lift generated ) . Rather than redesign the wings , many early aviators simply tried adding more wings . Of course , the problem with this was making sure that the structure to support all the wings was strong enough , which it often was n't . For example , here 's some newsreel footage of the same plane in the image you linked ( the [ Gerhardt Cycleplane ] ( URL_1 ) ): URL_0 Once aerodynamics were more well - understood , the need for multiple wings declined and eventually disappeared . It 's also worth noting that planes with multiple sets of wings can have problems if one set produces much more lift than the others . The Fokker Dr. I ( better known as simply the \" Fokker Triplane \" or the \" Red Baron 's plane \" ) , for example , had problems with the top wing producing so much more lift than the other two wings that the top wing would rip itself off of the aircraft at high speeds . This behavior tended to cause problems and was one of many reasons why , despite its prevalence in popular lore , the Dr. I saw only limited use in actual combat . So , the short answer to your question is that , with our ability to generate more than enough lift with a single set of wings , the need for multiple sets of wings has passed ."

                    "Planes with multiple wings, like the one in the image you provided, are called \"multiplane\" or \"sesquiplane\" designs. These designs were experimented with in the early days of aviation, but they were not widely used because they did not perform as well as planes with fewer wings. \nThere are several reasons why planes with multiple wings are not typically used. One reason is that they are more complex and expensive to build than planes with fewer wings. They also tend to be heavier and less efficient, which means that they require more power to fly and use more fuel. \nPlanes with two wings, or \"biplanes,\" were the most common design in the early days of aviation. They are still used today in some specialty applications, such as crop dusting or airshows. Most modern planes, however, have a single, long wing called a \"monoplane.\" This design is more aerodynamic and efficient, and it allows the plane to fly faster and further than a biplane. \nFour-winged planes, or \"quadruplanes,\" have also been experimented with, but they have not been widely used because they do not offer significant advantages over other designs. \nOverall, the number of wings on an airplane is determined by a combination of factors, including the size and weight of the plane, the type of mission it will be used for, and the desired performance characteristics. Engineers and designers carefully consider these factors when designing a new plane to ensure that it is safe, efficient, and capable of meeting the needs of its intended use."

In many people, there is not enough room in the mouth for the wisdom teeth to emerge properly, which can cause problems such as pain, infection, and crowding of the other teeth. \nIt's not entirely clear why wisdom teeth still exist if they can cause so many problems. Some scientists believe that wisdom teeth may have once served a useful purpose but are now vestigial, meaning that they have lost their original function due to evolution. Others think that wisdom teeth may still have some use, but more research is needed to understand this. \nOverall, wisdom teeth are a leftover from our ancestors' times and are not as important as they once were.

ISIS, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, is a militant group that has been designated as a terrorist organization by many governments around the world. The group has been known to engage in various illegal activities, including the sale of smuggled oil and other illicit goods, as a way to fund its operations. However, it is not a legitimate source of oil and it is not possible to buy oil from ISIS through legal channels. It is illegal to provide material support to terrorist organizations, including buying goods from them, and doing so can result in serious consequences. It is also worth noting that the global price of oil is determined by a variety of factors, including supply and demand, geopolitical considerations, and economic conditions, and is not directly related to the activities of ISIS."

This is important because the Milky Way is usually too dim to see with the naked eye, so you need to take a long exposure to capture it. \n2. A tripod: You'll need a tripod to hold your camera steady while you take the photo. This is important because if your camera moves even a little bit while the shutter is open, the photo will come out blurry. \n3. A dark sky: To see the Milky Way, you need to be somewhere with very little light pollution. This means you need to be far away from cities, which have lots of lights that can wash out the stars. \n4. The right time of year: The Milky Way is only visible in the night sky at certain times of the year. It's best to see it in the summer months when it's high in the sky. \nOnce you have all of these things, you can set up your camera on the tripod and take a long exposure photo of the Milky Way.

                    "Going to a grand jury * is * part of a normal trial ( at least for some kinds of cases ; it varies by state ) . A grand jury is a group of people that the prosecutor has to convince he has a case . He does n't have to prove that the defendant is guilty , just that there 's enough evidence that it 's OK to bring charges against them . The idea here is that the trial itself should not be inflicted upon someone who is obviously innocent — bringing charges must not be a weapon against innocent charges . Charging innocent people can still happen , but this step is intended to minimize it . The controversy is that generally grand juries are very easy to convince and many see them as a formality more than anything . When a high profile case does n't get an indictment ( i.e. a formal accusation against someone that a crime was committed ; pronounced in - dight - ment ) it raises a question of whether the prosecutor was really trying to get the grand jury to indict . Many feel that even though the officer in the Ferguson case would likely have been found innocent that it was not the prosecutor 's place to present such a weak case to the grand jury in order to stop the case then and there .",
                    "The constitution says : > No person shall be held to answer for a capital , or otherwise infamous crime , unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury , except in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the Militia , when in actual service in time of War or public danger In otherwords : Someone accused of committing murder has to have a Grand Jury say there 's probable cause for a trial . So : Step 1 : Grand Jury : is there enough evidence to have a trial for murder . Step 2 : Regular Jury : is he guilty of murder ? You do n't hear about Grand Juries because in over 99 % of cases brought , Grand Juries indict . Partially , because you only need 12 of 16 - 23 members to support indictment . At the federal level , [ 538 reports ] ( URL_0 ) 161,989 of 162,000 federal grand juries indict .",
                    "The grand jury is a preliminary proceeding for the purpose of deciding whether there is a good enough reason to have a trial . The difference between a grand jury and a normal jury ( i.e. , a trial ) is that a grand jury is a closed , one - sided hearing where the prosecutor is tasked with demonstrating that there is probable cause to believe that a defendant committed the particular crime . Usually , a two - thirds supermajority agreement among the jurors is required to \" indict \" the defendant ( i.e. , two - thirds of the jurors must agree that there exists probable cause to believe the defendant committed a crime , thus warranting a full trial ) . If two - thirds of the jurors indict the defendant , it does not mean he is convicted . It means there is enough evidence that there should be a full trial . Unlike during the grand jury , at a full trial the defendant enjoys his sixth amendment rights to counsel , to confront his accusers , and to a public proceeding . What I mean is that during a grand jury the defendant has no right to call his own witnesses , nor cross - examine witnesses that testify against him ( or more accurately have a lawyer do those things ) , and he has no right to public oversight . During a trial the defendant has a right to a lawyer , who can introduce evidence and call witnesses on his behalf and cross - examine opposing witnesses in an a hearing opened to public oversight . Also , the trial requires the jury to unanimously vote that he committed the crime beyond a reasonable doubt in order to convict him . This is a much harder standard than the grand jury 's 2/3 's majority vote for probable cause . It 's also worth noting that not all states employ grand juries . For example , in my state a preliminary hearing substitutes for the grand jury . During my state 's preliminary hearings , the prosecutor is tasked with introducing evidence before a judge ( without a jury ) , and the defendant has the right to have a lawyer argue against that evidence and cross examine the prosecutor 's witnesses . In this scenario the judge ( and not a jury ) decides whether there is enough probable cause for the case to go to trial . This is not to say that some states only do grand juries , and other states only do preliminary hearings . My state has certain policies where it will use a grand jury rather than a preliminary hearing , e.g. , where there is a danger of witness intimidation . I do n't know whether my state would use a grand jury for a capital case against a cop . Technically it would be at the District Attorney 's discretion , but it 's probably really just politics . Also , it should be noted that the rules regarding whether or not there must be a grand jury is different in federal courts . The fifth amendment preserves a defendant 's right to a grand jury for all \" capital , or otherwise infamous crime[s ] \" in federal courts . To sum it up , a grand jury is a process with a very low burden of proof for the purpose of deciding whether a full trial is necessary . Some states use preliminary hearings more often . Serious federal crimes require grand juries . And , some states courts use grand juries rather than preliminary hearings for specific cases ."

                    "A grand jury is a group of people who are chosen to decide whether there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime. If the grand jury decides that there is enough evidence, they will issue a \"true bill\" of indictment, which means that the person will be charged with a crime and will have to go to trial. \nGrand juries are different from normal juries in a few ways. One difference is that grand juries don't decide whether someone is guilty or not guilty. Their job is only to decide if there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime. Grand juries also don't have to follow the same rules as a normal trial. For example, the person being investigated by the grand jury doesn't have the right to be present or to have a lawyer present during the grand jury proceedings. \nIt's not uncommon for police officers to appear before a grand jury when they are being investigated for a crime. This might happen if someone has accused the police officer of wrongdoing, or if there is evidence that the officer broke the law. If the grand jury decides that there is enough evidence to charge the police officer with a crime, then the officer will have to go to trial to face those charges."

For a Cruze , budget pricing is going to be high on the list , and the top speed is maybe as high as 130MPH at a guess . Other dimensions include wet and dry grip , cold weather performance , rolling resistance ( very helpful for high EPA fuel economy estimates ) , road noise , resistance to wear , special features like runflat capability , etc . , etc . The formulation of the rubber compounds that go into the tire , the design of the tread , the layout of the steel ( and other materials ? ) belts that go into the casing , etc . , are all informed by which criteria are emphasized in the tire 's design .",
                    "A number of factors determine the cost of a tyre : * Speed ratings define how fast the tire can safely be driven - bigger more powerful vehicles require a different tyre to small / slow cars and as a result the tyres cost more ( see [ speed rating table ] ( URL_0 ) ) . * Load index - how much weight is the tyre expected to carry , this will have an impact on price * Width / Rim Size - the wider of tyre and size of the rim all adjust thevolume of rubber required and bigger tyres can require more complex tire designs . Your little car might take be R15 160/180 wide , a BMW Z4 ( for example ) will take R19s 225/255 tyres . * Profile - how ' fat ' is the side - profile ?

                    "There are a few factors that can make one tire better than another, and these factors can also contribute to differences in price. \nFirst, let's start with the basics: tires are made of rubber, and they have tread on the bottom that helps them grip the road. Tires also have a sidewall, which is the part of the tire that you can see between the tread and the wheel. The sidewall has important information printed on it, like the size of the tire and the maximum load and speed it can handle. \nNow, let's talk about some of the factors that can make one tire better than another: \n1. Performance: Some tires are designed for specific types of driving or weather conditions. For example, you might want a tire with a softer compound for better grip on a race track, or a tire with a lot of tread for better traction in the rain. Tires that are designed for high performance or specific driving conditions tend to cost more because they require more advanced materials and engineering. \n2. Quality: Tires can also vary in terms of quality, which can affect their performance and lifespan. Higher-quality tires are typically made with better materials and more advanced manufacturing processes, which can make them last longer and perform better. These tires tend to cost more, but they can save you money in the long run because you won't have to replace them as often. \n3. Brand: The brand of the tire can also affect the price. Some tire brands are known for making high-quality, high-performance tires that come with a higher price tag. Other brands might offer more budget-friendly options that may not have the same level of performance or quality. \nSo, to sum it up: tires can vary in price based on their performance, quality, and brand. Tires that are designed for high performance or specific driving conditions, made with high-quality materials and advanced manufacturing processes, or made by a well-known brand tend to cost more."

To do this, the movie is first divided into two separate images, one for the left eye and one for the right eye. These images are then slightly offset from each other to create the illusion of depth when viewed through special glasses that have one red lens and one blue lens (or one green and one magenta). \nThe process of converting a 2D movie into 3D is complex and time-consuming, and it involves using computer software to analyze the images and assign different levels of depth to different objects in the frame. This allows the 3D version of the movie to have a sense of depth and perspective that makes it feel more immersive and realistic. \nSo, to sum it up, movies that are not originally filmed in 3D can be made to look like they were filmed in 3D by using special computer software to create two slightly offset images and adding depth to different objects in the frame. When these images are viewed through special glasses, they create the illusion of 3D."

                    "Traditionally, new seasons of TV shows have premiered in the fall because that is when the major networks (like ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox) have their \"upfronts,\" which are presentations to advertisers about the new shows that they will be airing in the upcoming television season. The upfronts usually take place in May, and the new TV seasons begin in September. This allows the networks to promote their new shows to a large audience over the summer, so that people will be more likely to watch when the new seasons begin. \nThere are a few reasons why it might make sense for some shows to come out in the spring or summer instead. For one thing, there is typically less competition for viewership during these times of year, since there are fewer new shows premiering. This can be especially helpful for shows that are trying to establish a strong following and might get lost in the shuffle during the crowded fall season. Additionally, the weather is generally nicer in the spring and summer, which can make it a more appealing time for people to sit down and watch TV. \nOverall, it really depends on the show and what the creators and networks think will be the best time for it to be released. Some shows might be more successful in the fall, while others might do better in the spring or summer."

This can cause a number of physical symptoms, including feeling sick to your stomach and throwing up. \nThrowing up after a workout can also be a sign of overexertion, which means that you have pushed yourself too hard and your body is not able to handle the stress. Overexertion can cause your body to release certain hormones and chemicals that can make you feel sick and cause you to throw up. \nIt's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard when you are exercising.

Another group of countries with no - tax policies are tiny island nations like the Bahamas . for these countries , the populations are small , easing the government 's expenditure and they rely a lot on foreign investment , making it necessary for them to lure investors with favorable tax policies .

It is known for its luxury casinos, hotels, and high-end real estate. These industries bring in a lot of money for the government and help fund the services it provides to its citizens, such as education and healthcare. \nAnother way that countries with no tax policy can fund their governments is by charging fees for certain services, such as the use of roads or the sale of licenses.

My company occasionally does high rise tenant finish and when the tenant wants a new break room or two , and the executive wants a private bathroom in his corner office then things need to be happening on multiple floors at once . The drainage piping needs to be run on the floor below , which is likely occupied . To install new drainage plumbing in a high rise a large X - ray machine needs to be brought out and shoot beams of radiation up towards the slab to find what locations are available for drilling , ( this needs to be done from the floor below ) then we bring out large core drills which make lots of noise and spray mud everywhere , which requires us to cover all the office folks computers and desks / cabinets and family photos with tarps so when they get back in the morning they do n't know we were romping around their office the previous night . Then we need to take the ceiling grid panels out from the occupied floor and bring in the equipment to install the new piping .

Additionally, turning the lights off and on frequently can actually use more energy than leaving them on, because it takes energy to start up the lighting system each time it is turned on. \n5.

This is because each time the lights are turned on and off, it causes wear and tear on the lighting system, which can shorten its lifespan and increase maintenance costs. \nOverall, there are a number of factors to consider when deciding whether to keep the lights on in an office building or skyscraper, and it's not always as simple as just turning them off to save money."

It has to be followed up by a progressive spending system that helps put money effectively towards helping the lower income brackets . Also , in the US , most of the top earners make the majority of their money through investment , dividends , and capital gains , some of which are taxed at a much lower rate than standard income tax .

That a guy making a million a year pays more taxes ( and even a larger percent of his income in taxes ) than a guy working a minimum wage job does n't reduce the existing inequality by much , if those tax dollars are spent on wars in the Middle East or providing protection to the millionaire 's business interests .

                    "Progressive taxation is a system in which people who earn more money pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than people who earn less money. In the United States, the progressive tax system is designed to reduce income inequality by taking a larger percentage of income from people who are more able to pay, and using that money to fund programs and services that benefit the entire population, such as education, healthcare, and social security. \nHowever, there are still many factors that can contribute to inequality in the United States, even with a progressive tax system in place. For example, some people may have access to better education and job opportunities, which can lead to higher incomes. Additionally, there may be systemic biases and discrimination that make it more difficult for certain groups of people to advance in their careers or earn as much as others. \nFinally, the overall distribution of wealth in a society, rather than just income, also plays a role in inequality. Wealth, or the total value of a person's assets (such as their savings, investments, and property), can be passed down from generation to generation, which can create a more unequal distribution of resources over time. \nOverall, while a progressive tax system can help to reduce inequality, it is just one factor among many that contribute to the overall level of inequality in a society."

This is a process that happens in the center of the star, where the temperature and pressure are extremely high. In nuclear fusion, the hydrogen atoms combine to form helium atoms, and this releases a huge amount of energy in the form of light and heat. \nThis energy helps to hold the star up and keep it from collapsing in on itself. The energy from nuclear fusion also helps to push outwards against the weight of the outer layers of the star, which would otherwise cause the star to collapse. \nIn short, the energy produced by nuclear fusion helps to balance the forces acting on a star and keeps it from collapsing or exploding."

                    "When any part of our body is touched , nerves in the skin are activated . On the way to the brain , those nerves meet at several junctions or ' gates ' . At those junctions , bunches of nerves coming from nearby all gather together on the way to the brain At each gate , the signals from all the bundled nerves are processed together . Sometimes , two nerves work together to increase each other 's intensity , and sometimes , they dampen each other 's signals . At the same time , nerves coming from the brain work as ' central control ' to change the intensity of the signal that 's being passed on . Again , sometimes the signal is increased , and sometimes it 's decreased . Over the history of their development , our brains have gotten good at learning what signals they should pay attention to , and what signals they can ignore . One of the signals the brain has learned to ' ignore ' is self touch . It is n't dangerous , and we usually only need to be partially aware of it . Walking through a spider web and touching your hand to your face are two different experiences , and for good reason . When the brain identifies self - touch , it uses those feedback fibers I mentioned before to suppress the intensity of sensation , which makes it easier to ignore . Also , when a signal arrives in the brain , several regions cooperate to figure out exactly what it is , where it came from , and what to do about it . When we identify self - touch , there are regions of our brain that are trained to say ' ignore it ' . As a result , we suppress the intensity of those signals .",
                    "to put it simply , our nerves have gates that allow certain information to pass , when your scratching the itch yourself those gates are competing with each other to send information about pleasure , as well as touch and muscle contraction . Having someone else do it means there is only the pleasure sensation needing to be sent through those gates , so the pleasure is stronger . an example of this is when your foot falls asleep and it feels like there are hot pins and needles in it . when the flow stops the nerves that react to touch and pressure stop , but the various pain receptors maintain priority and get what little oxygen is in the blood . so once you start using it those pain receptors are n't competing with anything and it 's all you feel .",

When someone else scratches your back, the sensation may be even more pleasurable because it combines the physical sensation of the scratching with the emotional pleasure of being touched by someone else. It's also possible that having someone else scratch your back may allow you to scratch in areas that are difficult to reach on your own, which could further increase the pleasure of the experience.

                    "Landing a spacecraft in a lake would not be a safe or practical way to return to Earth. Here are a few reasons why: \n1. Density: Water is much denser than air, so when a spacecraft falls into it from a high altitude, it will experience much more resistance and deceleration. This could cause the spacecraft to break apart or sustain serious damage upon impact. \n2. Depth: Lakes are typically not very deep, so if a spacecraft were to land in one, it would have to do so at a very low altitude. This would not give the spacecraft enough time to slow down and make a safe landing. \n3. Control: When a spacecraft returns to Earth, it needs to be able to control its descent and land in a specific location. This is not possible when landing in a lake, as the spacecraft would be at the mercy of the wind and currents. \n4. Recovery: Finally, it would be very difficult to recover a spacecraft that has landed in a lake. Specialized equipment would be needed to lift it out of the water, which could be time-consuming and costly. \nIn summary, landing a spacecraft in a lake is not a safe or practical option. Instead, spacecraft are designed to land on solid ground, where they can touch down at a controlled speed and be easily recovered."

The result is their net worth. \nFor example, if a person has $100,000 in savings, a house worth $300,000, and no debts, their net worth would be $400,000. On the other hand, if that same person had $100,000 in savings, a house worth $300,000, and a mortgage of $200,000, their net worth would be $200,000 (since they would be subtracting the $200,000 mortgage from their total assets of $400,000). \nNet worth is usually calculated by a person themselves, or by a financial advisor or accountant. It can be a useful way to track a person's financial progress over time and see how much wealth they have built up. \nIt's important to note that net worth is different from income, which is the money a person earns from working or investing.

                    "I think it goes without saying that government is n't really anything like personal debt but it might help put things in perspective using a more familiar idea we can grasp . Part of the problem with the perception of our debt being a big problem is that the numbers are big . Mind bogglingly big . Scary big . Our debt is roughly $ 17,000,000,000,000 . And , yes , that is a big number . But let me show you another number : $ 17,000,000,000,000 . Why , yes . That is the same number . $ 17,000,000,000,000 also happens to be our Gross Domestic Product or GDP , which is what our country produces in a year . Think of the GDP as our annual salary as a country . Now if you met a person who made $ 170,000 a year ( a much easier number to get your head around ) and that person was in debt to the tune of $ 170,000 say with a house a couple of credit cards and that person always paid all of his bills all the time , most people would say that person has very good credit and is n't at risk of going bankrupt and would likely be a particularly good candidate if they decided to get another loan . And so long as their income grows proportionally with their debt and they keep paying their bills , they 'll continue to be a safe bet to continue to receive loans . In other words , if their debt rose to $ 200,000 , that 'd be okay if their income was also in the neighborhood of $ 200,000 . Now what you want to know is : Can the debt ever be repaid ? And the simple answer is , \" yes , but you would n't really want to \" . Keeping our house metaphor in tact for the time being , if we wanted to get out of debt , we could pay less for the stuff we use and use the difference to pay down our debt . But there 's a problem : What do we cut ? Food ? Medicine ? Clothing ? Home Security ? Everything we 're spending money on we more or less need . Sure , we could nibble around the edges and find a few dollars here and there , but not enough to make a really big difference . Going back to our full scale US debt , it sounds good to say you 're going to cut our $ 10 million budget for ketchup research or $ 6 million in pork for a courthouse in Milwaukee , but that 's like saying you 're going to pay off your mortgage by rummaging around for spare change in your couch . When trillions are on the table , millions wo n't cut it and billions will barely touch it . Which is n't to say it 's impossible . Just about 20 years ago the Clinton administration had a plan to pay down the national debt by raising taxes and cutting spending . According to that plan , we would have paid off the national debt by the far off future year of 2011 . Unfortunately , when we went to war in Afghanistan and Iraq in 2002 and 2003 , that added expense sidelined the debt repayment and ballooned our debt . And then in 2008 and 2009 the financial crisis happened and various stimulus packages and tax relief packages meant our debt ballooned again . It 's really been a lousy decade for debt and deficit . But have no fear : Should we do the obvious yet politically suicidal thing of raising taxes and cutting spending we can get our debt under control again ( until the next big crisis , at least ) . But we do n't want to pay it off , mostly because a lot of our debt is n't owned by foreign countries : it 's owned by people like you and me in the form of government bonds . ( Basically you buy XX in IOUs from the government and they 'll pay you back XX plus interest after a given amount of time and these are generally seen as safe but low(er ) return parts of many investment portfolios for individuals and businesses . ) If the government is debt free , that means there are no bonds to invest in , which is n't very good for the economy . Economists might disagree on how much debt is good and how much is bad but most would agree that it 's best to have some . So that it . Our debt is big , but it 's not concerning because it 's about the same size as our GDP . It should probably be at least a little smaller , which is simple and hard because everyone knows what needs to be done ( higher taxes and lower spending ) but nobody is willing to do it . But much like needing to lose weight you ca n't just exercise more OR cut calories , you 've got to do both . And while we could one day , 20 , 30 years from now slowly get to zero with modest cuts and tax hikes , we do n't really need to or want to because it would mean lower , slower economic growth as a nation and fewer quality investment opportunities for individuals and businesses .",

Remember that there is good debt and bad debt . If you owe me 50 $ and do n't pay , you have a problem . If you owe me $ 50,000,000 and do n't pay , I 've got a problem ."

The debt is currently about $28 trillion and it is possible for it to be repaid, but it would require the government to make regular payments to its creditors to reduce the balance. \nThere are a few ways that the government could make these payments: \n1. By running budget surpluses: This means that the government would bring in more money through taxes and other revenues than it spends on things like defense, education, and healthcare. The extra money could be used to pay down the debt. \n2. By selling assets: The government could sell things like land, buildings, or other assets to raise money to pay off the debt. \n3. By growing the economy: If the economy grows, the government will bring in more money through taxes, which could be used to pay down the debt. \nIt is important to note that the national debt is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it can be a useful tool for the government to fund important projects and stimulate the economy. However, if the debt gets too large, it can become difficult for the government to make the necessary payments, which could lead to financial problems."

It is a common resolution for laptops because it provides enough detail for most tasks, such as web browsing and document editing, without requiring a lot of processing power. This means that laptops with 1366x768 screens can be more energy efficient, which is important for devices that are often used on the go. Additionally, 1366x768 is a common resolution for LCD panels, which are used in many laptop displays, so it is often easier and more cost-effective for manufacturers to use this resolution."

It says we have freedom of speech . It does n't matter whether we 're speaking in the public square , over the broadcast airwaves , or in a YouTube video .

Even though it was created a long time ago, it is still relevant today because it sets out the basic principles and structure of the government and protects certain fundamental rights of the people. These principles and rights are still important today, even though technology and society have changed a lot since the Constitution was written. \nFor example, the Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, religion, and the press. These rights are important no matter what technology is being used, because they protect the ability of people to express their ideas and beliefs without fear of punishment. \nThe Constitution also sets out the powers of the different branches of government, such as the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. These powers are still important today, because they help to ensure that the government is accountable to the people and that no one branch of government becomes too powerful. \nSo even though the Constitution was written a long time ago, it is still very relevant today because it sets out the basic principles and structure of the government and protects important rights of the people."

So they added greenlight as a sort of popularity system . It got abused ( suprise ! ) and so they went back to the drawing board . Thus they added Early Access . ( which seems to work more or less ) but they never removed greenlight - which they stated they were planning on removing . so we 'll see when that happens .

Greenlight was a way for the community to vote on which games they wanted to see on Steam. \nIn order for a game to be released on Steam, it had to go through the Greenlight process. Developers would submit their game to Greenlight and the community could then vote on whether or not they wanted to see the game on Steam. If a game received enough votes, it would be approved and released on Steam. \nValve created Greenlight as a way to get more games on Steam and to involve the community in the process of deciding which games should be released. It also gave smaller developers a chance to get their games on Steam even if they didn't have a publisher or a big marketing budget. \nOverall, the goal of Greenlight was to help Valve make more money by getting more games on Steam and increasing the number of people using the platform."

                    "When a company or individual owes money to another company or individual, that debt is known as a \"credit obligation.\" Sometimes, the company or individual who is owed money may not have the resources or the desire to try to collect the debt themselves. In these cases, they may decide to sell the debt to another company. \nThe company that buys the debt is usually hoping to make a profit by collecting the debt from the person or company who owes it. They do this by contacting the debtor and trying to get them to pay the debt. If they are successful in getting the debtor to pay, then the company that bought the debt makes a profit. \nHere's an example: \nCompany A sells a product to Company B for $100.\nCompany B doesn't pay Company A for the product.\nCompany A decides it doesn't want to try to collect the debt, so it sells the debt to Company C for $50.\nCompany C contacts Company B and tries to get them to pay the debt.\nIf Company B agrees to pay the debt, then Company C will have made a profit of $50 ($100 - $50 = $50). \nSo, in short, companies that buy and re-sell debt make money by collecting the debts that they have purchased and keeping the difference between the amount they paid for the debt and the amount they were able to collect."

Let 's say I 'm at the top of a tower and I drop a book . Without really looking , I can pretty much guess it 's position after 1 second , given it 's size , weight , wind speed , earth 's gravity pull etc etc . You can find any of those attributes , given the others . So that 's the expectation of us taking stuff from the macro world and trying to apply it to the micro world . Moving on . Now this book , say the physicists consists of atoms , and those atoms consist of various particles .

Well ... yes ... that 's * * if you can do that * * . Heisenberg 's uncertainty principle basically says : * * You ca n't really know everything about a particle at any given time . If you predict it 's position , you ca n't predict it 's momentum . And the more accurate you can predict it 's position , the less accurate you can predict it 's momentum ( and vice versa ) . * *",

                    "Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is a fundamental idea in quantum mechanics, which is a theory that describes how very small things (like atoms and subatomic particles) behave. According to the uncertainty principle, it is impossible to know both the exact position and the exact momentum (speed and direction) of a particle at the same time. \nThis might seem strange, but imagine trying to measure the position of a small insect flying around a room. If you want to know exactly where the insect is, you might try to shine a flashlight on it. But as soon as you shine the light on the insect, you change its momentum (because the light has energy, and when it hits the insect it gives some of that energy to the insect). So now you know where the insect is, but you don't know its momentum as well as you did before. On the other hand, if you don't shine any light on the insect, you might be able to figure out its momentum (for example, by clapping your hands and trying to chase it), but now you don't know its position as well as you did before. \nThe uncertainty principle tells us that there is always a trade-off between knowing the position and knowing the momentum of a particle. The more precisely we know one of these things, the less precisely we can know the other. This is a fundamental aspect of the nature of the universe at very small scales, and it has important implications for how we understand the world around us."
